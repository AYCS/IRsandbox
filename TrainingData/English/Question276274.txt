This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received one half of the marked stick as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually tamper proof. One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. <strong>The longer part was called <em>stock</em></strong> and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. </p>\n  \n  <p>The <strong>shorter portion of the stick was called</strong> <strong><em>foil</em></strong> and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. </p>\n  \n  <p>If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, those notches would not be on the other tally stick and would be revealed as an attempted forgery. </p>\n  \n  <p>The <em>split tally</em> was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the Napoleonic Code (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333. Along the Danube and in Switzerland the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies. </p>\n  \n  <p>The person with the short end of the stick was in a bad spot because they were in debt to the person holding the longer side. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: Virtual Exhibitions in Informatics <a href=\"http://cs-exhibitions.uni-klu.ac.at/index.php?id=319\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tally Sticks</a></p>\n\n<p>An image of a medieval tally stick, courtesy of Wikipedia</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yy3dQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yy3dQ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Medieval English <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>split tally stick</em></a> (front and reverse view).

(See, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>'<a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/129048/43330\">The words \"hysterical\" and \"hysterectomy\" share the same root in the word for \"uterus\"</a>.'</li>\n<li>'<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the Greek ὑστέρα hystera \"uterus\"</a>.'</li>\n<li>'<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_hysteria\" rel=\"nofollow\">the term hysteria ... stems from the Greek cognate of uterus, ὑστέρα (hystera)</a>.'</li>\n<li>'<a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hysterical\" rel=\"nofollow\">from Latin <em>hystericus</em> \"of the womb,\" from Greek <em>hysterikos</em> \"of the womb, suffering in the womb,\" from <em>hystera</em> \"womb\" (see <em>uterus</em>)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So what gives?
