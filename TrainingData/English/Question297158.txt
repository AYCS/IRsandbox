The particular sentences are marked in bold, and I've added some background, for the context.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background-</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Elle, are you all right?” </p>\n  \n  <p>“I’m fine.” </p>\n  \n  <p>“You’re not acting fine.” </p>\n  \n  <p>I turned my face to let water splash on it. “My father just died,\n  Dan,and I went on a bender. How fine do you think I am?” </p>\n  \n  <p>He rubbed my back. “Okay, I get it. Ask a stupid question—” </p>\n  \n  <p>“Exactly.” I wasn’t up to verbal sparring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Context-</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was to be a funeral, of course, and a gathering at the house,\n  after. The perfect theater for my drama-queen mother to parade her\n  grief in front of friends and family. I didn’t begrudge her, really.\n  She’d never been a perfect mother or wife, and I had my issues with\n  her, but she had been married to the man, after all. She’d chosen to\n  stay with him. She’d earned her martyr’s crown.</p>\n  \n  <p>Considering my father’s body had enough alcohol in it <strong>to keep him\n  pickled for a year, she nonetheless wasted no time in setting it all\n  up.</strong> <strong>If she couldn’t wait to get him into the ground, I don’t suppose I\n  can blame her.</strong> I understood that urgency, that sense of having to\n  always get the worst out of the way so as to move on to something\n  else. I’d learned it from her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the sentences in question are- </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Considering my father’s body had enough alcohol in it to keep him\n  pickled for a year, she nonetheless wasted no time in setting it all\n  up.  If she couldn’t wait to get him into the ground, I don’t suppose\n  I can blame her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, I found the most accurate definition of \"pickled\" in this context from this <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pickled\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merriam-Webster link</a> which says- </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>pickled</strong> <em>adjective</em> </p>\n  \n  <p>preserved with salt water or vinegar</p>\n  \n  <p>very drunk or intoxicated</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are some related sentences where \"pickled\" is used in this conext-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Examples of <strong>PICKLED</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>He got pickled at the office party.</p>\n  \n  <p>I must have been rather pickled when I agreed to your stupid scheme.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the above description, it is clear that \"pickled\" in the sentence in question is intended to mean \"drunk\". Am I correct in this assessment?</p>\n\n<p>If yes, my question is the next part of the sentence, which says- </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>she nonetheless wasted no time <strong>in setting it all up</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Considering that her father had enough alcohol in him to keep him pickled(read: drunk) for a year, what was set up? My first thought was the setting-up of a casket, and/or other funeral setting, but this doesn't sit well with the first part of the sentence.</p>\n\n<p>My last question is the first part of the next sentence- </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If she couldn’t wait to get him into the ground</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does this mean? Is it supposed to mean something on the lines of- she wanted to be over with the funeral as soon as possible?</p>\n"},{"id":46338,"title":"Is there a better term for &#39;low-level?&#39;","body":"<p>In computer programming, <em>low-level</em> means something used as a base upon which to build more complex mechanisms.
