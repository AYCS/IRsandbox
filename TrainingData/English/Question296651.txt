","body":"<p>I'm not sure how well known <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier,_Virginia#Isolation\">Tangier Island</a> is outside the Chesapeake region. To make a long story short, Tangier Island is an isolated fishing community in the Chesapeake bay. It has been mostly isolated for hundreds of years. You constantly hear that the accent has remained unchanged since the 17th century. This accent is often cited as an example of what an Elizabethan accent would sound like.</p>\n\n<p>My question is — without audio recordings, how can one make conclusions about how the accent has changed? What do we truly know about the Elizabethan accent that we can use to infer that the Tangier accent is very close? Is it actually close or has it just evolved down its own line?</p>\n"},{"id":207957,"title":"Why do some people say &quot;v&quot; as &quot;w&quot;?","body":"<p>I've noticed that Germans and Indians will sometimes say \"<code>/w/</code>ector space\" instead of \"<code>/v/</code>ector space\".</p>\n\n<p>I get that in German <code>\"w\"</code> is pronounced <code>/v/</code>.

As a non-native speaker, I hear this sound as not being a pure and clean sound. I mean I know that every vowel sound may vary depending on whether the syllable is stressed, on the accent of the person that makes the sound, etc. But generally this sound is the same in the sense that it does not depend on the consonant sounds that come before or after, and might or might not be heard as being different by the non-native speaker ear.</p>\n\n<p>The schwa sound is a very difficult one for me because I cannot find a pattern to follow. When I was learning the other vowel sounds I could analyze a long list of words being pronounced (by the same person of course) and then abstract the sound so I can produce it perfectly. But this does not work for the schwa sound. So for example I hear one sound in words like <strong>a</strong>-bout, b-<strong>a</strong>-loon, decim-<strong>a</strong>-l, and a different sound in words like s-<strong>u</strong>-ppose and impet-<strong>u</strong>-s, t-<strong>o</strong>-day or t-<strong>o</strong>-night. Also in words like Ros-<strong>a</strong>-'s and ros-<strong>e</strong>-s, the schwa sounds differently.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to words that have the schwa sound on vowels <strong>e</strong> an <strong>i</strong> like in the word insan-<strong>i</strong>-ty then the sound is almost the one for the <strong>i</strong> in t-<strong>i</strong>-p, but also in words like b-<strong>e</strong>-hind I hear some people say it with a schwa sound like in <strong>a</strong>-bout and some other people pronounce it like the <strong>i</strong> in p-<strong>i</strong>-t. So, I would really appreciate an explanation about how you perceive this sound and how you would explain it to someone who, like me, is not a native speaker.</p>\n"},{"id":198586,"title":"Why is the &#39;t&#39; in &#39;nextdoor neighbour&#39; usually silent?

But, I double checked with some other English Language scholars and they say that this isn't true at all. </p>\n\n<p>They point out lots of examples where the 't' usually disappears but the next consonant isn't a /d/, isn't made in the same place, and isn't the same type of consonant.
