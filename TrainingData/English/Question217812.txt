One of the sentences in question is the following:</p>\n\n<p><em>In performing a book-to-tax reconciliation, you must identify those items of income and deduction which differ from book to tax.</em></p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to figure out what the appropriate meaning of <em>in</em> would be here (my intuition says that it's roughly synonymous with <em>when</em> or <em>while</em>.) It is <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/in#English\" rel=\"nofollow\">covered in Wiktionary</a> (under \"used to indicate limit, qualification, condition, or circumstance\") but in their examples <em>in</em> seems to carry more of a sense of <em>by</em>, and I don't think that sense applies to the above.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know what this is called and have a source where it's precisely defined?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":138898,"title":"Participles?
