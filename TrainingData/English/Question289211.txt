But while I was helping a young Italian student with their English homework, I saw their exercise book expressed height <em>only</em> in centimetres. I thought this was rather odd, not wrong, just odd.  I know that Americans express people's weight in pounds whereas the British stick to the imperial system of stones and ounces; while the rest of Europe (to the best of my knowledge) use kilos and grams. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to be certain whether <em>all</em> Americans, Australians and British express metric height in the same way, (i.e. in centimetres) or if there are regional differences.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Although I always mention to private students that Americans and the British still prefer the imperial system for people's weight and height, I cannot expect a ten-year-old Italian child to know their height in feet and in inches, and why should they? I cannot expect them to tell me the height of the Eiffel Tower in feet (1,063 ft) or miles (0.186 mi).  </p>\n"},{"id":127307,"title":"How do they express the time, in American and British English?","body":"<p>I don't know if this is a good question.
