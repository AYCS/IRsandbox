Why does one need a parenthetical comma in the beginning of the sentence after a conjunction but not in the middle if the only difference is period instead of comma before a coordinating conjunction. </p>\n\n<p>So, according to Gregg, this is correct punctuation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I told Calahan that we would not reorder unless he cut his prices by 20 percent. And, to my total amazement, he did. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>BUT:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I told Calahan that we would not reorder unless he cut his prices by 20 percent, and to my total amazement, he did. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notice no comma in the second sentence. </p>\n\n<p>You could say that the first parenthetical comma could be dropped on the grounds of prettiness / clarity to avoid excessive punctuation but in this case:</p>\n\n<p>a) It's more logical to drop the comma preceding the coordinating conjunction (and retain the first parenthetical comma)</p>\n\n<p>b) If we were to punctuate the 2 sentences like Gregg advises, then the two sentences read differently as in the first one we are forcing a break / speech pause after a conjunction. And surely, the sentences should not be read differently just because the period before the coordinating conjunction is replaced by a comma? </p>\n\n<p>Is there a grammatical rule on this or in cases like that it's simply a style matter?</p>\n\n<p>I am asking because I personally prefer to drop the first parenthetical comma after a coordinating conjunction on the basis that coordinating conjunction does not have any syntactic role in the clause -- it simply connects the two clauses acting as connector making anything that comes after it an introductory element which would only have one comma in the beginning of the sentence if the conjunction is to be dropped? </p>\n\n<p>Also the natural speech pattern seems to suggest that and the rules above address this situation in the middle of the sentence but not in the beginning?</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>A side question: if dropping the first parenthetical comma does turn out to be a mere style preference, would that be acceptable in the formal written works like academic reports and papers (logic being, if the rule is acceptable, it's acceptable in every writing piece).</p>\n"},{"id":263245,"title":"Correct structure of a comparative-type sentence with dependent clauses","body":"<p>The original sentence says:\n\"The greater the amount of total suspended solids the higher the turbidity of the water.\"</p>\n\n<p>I think it feels off because it lacks a verb.

In these instances, it would be as simple as moving the dependent clauses to the ends of the sentences, but are they correct as they are?

Should such sentences always be reworded? Are the example sentences correct as I have written them? Should semicolons replace the commas at the end of the dependent clauses?
