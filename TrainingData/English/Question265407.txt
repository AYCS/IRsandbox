A British regiment is facing an Afghan army:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he lower end of the valley appeared to be filled by an army in position—real and actual regiments attired in red coats, and—of this there was no doubt—firing Martini-Henry bullets which cut up the ground a hundred yards in front of the leading company. Over that pock-marked ground the Regiment had to pass, and it opened the ball with a general and profound courtesy to the <strong>piping pickets</strong>; ducking in perfect time, as though it had been brazed on a rod.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand “piping pickets” is figurative language meaning the Afghan soldiers firing at the British. But what, in the literal sense, would a piping picket be? </p>\n\n<p>I suppose <em>piping</em> means <em>pipe-playing</em>, figuratively meaning shooting. Then my best interpretation is that picket (see <a href=\"http://beta.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/picket\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merriam-Webster</a>) refers to a detached group of soldiers guarding an army from surprise (<a href=\"http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/picket_1?q=picket\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries</a> says guarding a military base). The reason I’m not entirely satisfied by this is that I don’t think lines of infantrymen at the head of an army engaging the enemy can properly be called a picket, and actual guarding pickets would most likely not play pipes.</p>\n\n<p>A picket may also be people standing or marching in protest, but I cannot see how these would fit. </p>\n\n<p>So is there anything that “piping pickets” literally refers to? </p>\n"},{"id":246047,"title":"What does &quot;discover from itself&quot; mean in the following sentence?","body":"<p>The sentence is </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The point of interest was to determine how far the natural light of reason, human reason by itself, could progress in the knowledge of truth, with the important proviso that through religion humans could learn higher truths than reason is in a position to discover from itself?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Could you please help me clarify this sentence as well?

Here is the context :\n\"Few topics generate more controversy than capacity credits for wind plant. The capacity credit of any power plant may be defined as a measure of the ability of the plant to contribute to the peak demands of a power system. Capacity credit is often defined as the ratio (firm power capability)/(rated output). As thermal plant is not 100 per cent reliable, values for all plant are <strong>less than unity</strong>. To a first order, 1,000 MW of nuclear plant corresponds to about 850 MW of firm power and hence has a capacity credit of 0.85; coal plant has a capacity credit of about 0.75.
