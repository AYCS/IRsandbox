In #8, if <em>my height</em> is just a noun phrase, that would mean that <em>He</em>, the subject, <em>is</em> actually a height, but he's a person, not a height any other form of measurement (Same for <em>six feet</em> in #6). Daniel δ suggests that #10 is short for \"I saw a man who was my height yesterday\", but something seems special about this construction. If <em>height</em> is just a noun, then why does switching it for some other noun like <em>lawyer</em> fail? We could say \"He is a lawyer\" but not \"I saw a man a lawyer yesterday\". But <em>my height</em> does make sense as a noun in #9, since we can call <em>about</em> a preposition that just takes <em>my height</em> as part of a prepositional phrase...</li>\n<li>As <strong>FumbleFingers</strong> noted, #11 can be interpreted in at least two ways. I'm interested in the sense that fits the analogy #8:#9 :: #10:#11.</li>\n</ul>\n"}]}]
