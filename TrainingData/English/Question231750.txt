I'm not looking for literary analysis or attempts to parse the metaphorical meaning of the song, I'm just trying to decide how the word 'mercy' should be interpreted in that sentence.</p>\n\n<p>I did a little research by looking at definition of the word mercy, and seeing if any included a verb version, but was unable to find such a thing. I did however find a blog post about a bible translation saying that 'mercy' was used to translate a greek phrase that contained a verb for mercy, rather than a noun.</p>\n\n<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p>So, can 'mercy' be used as a verb? Looks like not, so how would you interpret it being used as such?
