I manage to handle them pretty well, that is until I come across some exceptionts I can not fully comprehend. Case in pont: I'm reading \"Yiddish Policemen's Union\" by Michael Chabon. The author sometimes uses structures like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"(...) a faithful person could find encouragement, and a faithless one ample reason to despond\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"(...) his bowed legs and simian arms affixed to his neck without apparent benefit of shoulders.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as I'm concerned both \"benefit\" and \"reason\" are countable and singular, so why would Chabon omit articles, that, to my eye, should be put before them?
