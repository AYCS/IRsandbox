[{"id":296641,"title":"What is the origin of the phrase &quot;pilgrims and strangers in the/this world&quot;?","body":"<p>I came across the phrase \"we are pilgrims, and strangers in the world\" recently in something I was reading and made a note of it.  I remembered reading it in David Copperfield, but I seem to have been mistaken about that.  It must be a phrase with deep roots, though, because Google finds a <em>ton</em> of matches in writings about Christianity.</p>\n\n<p>The oldest match I can find for \"pilgrims and strangers in the/this world\" is in <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pilgrim%27s_Progress\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Pilgrim's Progress</a></em> (by John Bunyan, London: 1678):  \"The men told them that they were Pilgrims and Strangers in the World....\"  (Sorry, I don't have enough internet points to post links to all the sources.)</p>\n\n<p>I also found a pointer to Chapter IV of the General Constitutions of the Franciscan order, which is titled \"Pilgrims and strangers in this world\"  (<a href=\"http://www.ofm.org/ofm/?page_id=485\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ofm.org/ofm/?page_id=485</a>) and which contains the following sentence:  \"As pilgrims and strangers in this world, having given up personal property, the friars are to acquire neither house nor place nor any other things for themselves, in accordance with the Rule.\"  As best as I can tell, this document was written in the 1950s, so it doesn't predate <em>The Pilgrim's Progress</em>, but the chapter title is followed by the following citation:  \"(1Pt 2,11; Rb 6,2)\"</p>\n\n<p>1 Peter 2:11 is rendered in the King James Bible as, \"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\"  I don't know what Rb 6,2 refers to.</p>\n\n<p>The closest match in the Bible seems to be Hebrews 11:13:  \"These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.\"  However, the phrase does not seem to come directly from the Bible since no English translation (<a href=\"http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm</a>) renders it as \"strangers and pilgrims in the/this world.\"  And if this is the source why would the General Constitutions chapter heading cite 1 Peter 2:11 instead of this verse?</p>\n\n<p>So what is the specific source of this phrase that occurs in so many places from <em>The Pilgrim's Progress</em> to Franciscan rules to evangelical sermons?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":100330,"title":"What is the origin of the phrase &quot;Life is too short to ...&quot;?","body":"<p>As the title says, what is the origin of the phrase \"Life is too short to ...\" used with things conventionally expected, but which you do not want to do?</p>\n\n<p>Example: Life is too short to find a pair of matching socks.</p>\n"},{"id":149062,"title":"What is the origin of the phrase &quot;it&#39;s a horse apiece&quot;?","body":"<p>My wife from Wisconsin and her family use the phase \"it's a horse apiece\".

I've seen the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gardyloo\">Wiktionary:</a> \"Garde à l'eau\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gardyloo\">The Free Dictionary:</a> \"Gare à l'eau\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/what-is-the-origin-of-the-word-loo\">oxforddictionaries.com:</a> \"Regardez l'eau\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://unusedwords.com/2012/11/15/gardyloo/\">unusuedwords.com:</a> \"Garde de l'eau\" or \"Gardez l'eau\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm not a French speaker, but from what I remember, I would expect that the imperative \"look out\" or \"watch for\" would be given using the \"-ez\" ending (second person plural / formal) versus the \"e\" ending (second person singular / informal), so I suspect that it's probably \"Gardez\" or \"Regardez.\" However, I don't know enough French to know whether \"Gardez l'eau\" or \"Garde à l'eau\" would be grammatically or semantically correct.</p>\n\n<p>What French phrase actually gives rise to \"gardyloo?\" If it's not entirely clear, could someone at least enlighten me as to which of the above phrases would be grammatically and semantically correct?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"id":19331,"title":"What is the origin of the phrase ‘By the by...’?","body":"<p>What is the origin of the phrase 'By the by...'?</p>\n"},{"id":223892,"title":"Etymology of &quot;[Where/What/Why] in the world&quot; idiom?","body":"<p>I've searched the internet and found definitions, but I cannot figure out when this would have EVER meant anything.

I remarked that that should be \"the twelfth hour\". This then started me wondering where that apparently nonsensical phrase came from. It means at the last minute, of course, but in what sense is the eleventh hour the last minute? A quick google finds, for example <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eleventh_hour\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eleventh_hour</a>, but that doesn't really explain anything. The Biblical usage seems to mean \"late in the day\" (apparently 5 pm or so), not \"at the last minute\".
