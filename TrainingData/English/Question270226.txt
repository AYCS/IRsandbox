The one answer I got is not satisfactory. So that's the reason I am asking it here again. <a href=\"http://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/52831/preposition-before-noun-phrases\">Link to ELL post</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have seen in some cases prepositions are omitted before some noun phrases. And it's explained that those phrases are actually an adverb phrases. But I know a simple thing. If the head of the phrase is a noun, it's a noun phrase. If the head of the phrase is an adverb it is an adverb phrase.</p>\n\n<p>For example -</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Look <strong>both ways</strong> before crossing the road. [<strong>both ways</strong> is a noun phrase, where the head is <strong>ways</strong>, but still there is no preposition.]</p></li>\n  <li><p>He approached me <em>in</em> <strong>a friendly way</strong>. [<strong>a friendly way</strong> is a noun phrase, where the head is <strong>way</strong>, but as expected unlike sentence #1 it's preceded by the preposition <strong>in</strong>. And I have never seen this phrase is used without a preposition. I believe dropping the preposition is wrong, according to the grammar.]</p></li>\n  <li><p>She made a pickle <strong>a different way</strong> from her mother. [<strong>a different way</strong> is a noun phrase, where the head is <strong>way</strong>, but strangely there is no preposition before it. But I have seen examples of <strong>a different way</strong> used both with prepositions and without prepositions. I think the preposition here is optional.]</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now from these example sentences I have tried to demonstrate my problem/confusing area. My question is - </p>\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> When a noun phrase is used as an adverb phrase?</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> When before a noun phrase the placement of preposition is obligatory (like sentence #2)? And where it's optional (like sentence #3)?
