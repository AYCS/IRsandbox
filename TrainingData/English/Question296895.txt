Nothing I tried seems to make sense.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He was died. (incorrect grammar)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to: <a href=\"http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/passive.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">grammar.ccc.commnet.edu</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Verbs are also said to be either active (The executive committee approved the new policy) or passive (The new policy was approved by the executive committee) in voice. </p>\n  \n  <p>In the active voice, the subject and verb relationship is\n  straightforward: the subject is a be-er or a do-er and the verb moves\n  the sentence along.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is neither a do-er\n  or a be-er, but is acted upon by some other agent or by something\n  unnamed (The new policy was approved).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In reality, it seems like death is an agent that can act upon a living entity against its' will. A person might go through the dying process all the while fighting death. Finally, if the person is taken by death against their wishes; then we can't use the <code>active voice</code>. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose it could be said that \"he has been taken by death\". However, the verb <code>die</code> seems unusable. In the scenario above, he was not the do-er or the be-er.</p>\n"},{"id":216326,"title":"What verb tense does the phrase &quot;is been living&quot; belong to?","body":"<p>I have seen the following phrase:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We're been living here since April.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And I'm confused what is the verb tense that is used here.
