Some questions on my mind are: is there a name for this kind of \"mis-parsing\" of such a sentence? Are there known similar examples? Is my reaction normal from a linguistic/grammatical standpoint (e.g. is the intended meaning completely grammatically correct)? Is this confusion common among learners? How about among native speakers?</p>\n"},{"id":256639,"title":"Moonlight raked the lawn","body":"<p>Years ago, I saw a discussion about a writer who had, allegedly without humorous intent, injected some surprising atmosphere into a story by saying that \"moonlight raked the lawn\".</p>\n\n<p>The contributors to the discussion all recognised the silliness of the metaphor, and vigorously tried to analyse the nature of this gaffe — without, it must be said, achieving any great insight.</p>\n\n<p>In the process, what became clear is that few people could invent other metaphors that produced the same type of comic effect.
