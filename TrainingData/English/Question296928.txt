For example</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/noun\" rel=\"nofollow\">noun</a></strong> <em>grammar</em> any member of a class of words that can function as a ...</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/verb\" rel=\"nofollow\">verb</a></strong> <em>grammar</em> any member of a class of words that function as the main elements of predicates, that typically express action ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By \"not changing form\", I mean the noun, adjective, verb etc. forms are spelled (and possibly pronounced) exactly the same. An example that doesn't fit this would be <strong>late</strong>, which is an adjective and has an adverb form of <strong>lately</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I thought of the example word 'complex' last night and wondered if there were a noun that encompasses such words.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/complex\" rel=\"nofollow\">comÂ·plex</a></strong>  [adj., v. kuhm-pleks, kom-pleks; n. kom-pleks]</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>adjective</em></strong> 1 - composed of many interconnected parts; compound; composite: <em>a complex highway system</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>noun</em></strong> 6 - an intricate or complicated association or assemblage of related things, parts, units, etc.: the entire complex of our educational system; an apartment complex.</p>\n\n<p>And in researching this, I discovered that there is also a verb form of complex specific to chemistry:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>verb (used with object)</em></strong> 12 - Chemistry . to form a complex with.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to using a situation where a the word in question can be repeated immediately in a sentence and still be grammatically correct (but admittedly confusing).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>My apartment is part of a complex complex.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, I found a <a href=\"http://www.sporcle.com/games/puckett86/homonyms\" rel=\"nofollow\">brain teaser game</a> which fits what I was looking for, providing 24 other examples, but doesn't define things any more precisely. I also found this <a href=\"http://www.englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-adjective.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">interesting tutorial</a> covering the case where nouns are used in their exact <em>nounal</em> meaning but take the place of an adjective in a sentence. One of their examples: <strong>horse race</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is this: Is there a word which describes or defines words such as these exactly? It would have a definition like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&lt;<strong><em>mystery word</em></strong>> <em>noun</em></p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>A word which itself may function as various parts of grammar without changing spelling or meaning.</li>\n  <li>A word which has reached such widespread usage that it has definitions or meanings as a noun, verb, adjective, and/or adverb, all of which have the same origin or root word.</li>\n  <li>A word that is a homonym of itself.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have thought of and dismissed <em>homonym</em>, <em>homograph</em>, <em>homophone</em> etc. because they stipulate variously that the spelling, pronunciation or both are the same but differ in meaning and/or origin. I'm specifically looking for words that sound and are spelled the same and <strong>also</strong> have the same (or very similar) meaning and origin.</p>\n\n<p>Excellent examples from the quiz I linked <em>(spoiler alert)</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have a sore sore.</li>\n<li>That mammoth is mammoth!</li>\n<li>I've never told anyone the combination, so my safe is still safe.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":81520,"title":"Is there a word for left-to-right and top-to-bottom?","body":"<p>When I was learning about web design, and I remember similar things from art classes, people said that the eye sees things the most on a page which are in a line from the top-left to bottom-right corners. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a word or phrase for that line?
