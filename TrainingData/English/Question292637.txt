Bush went to the Islamic Center in Washington and said, ''Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes.'' In remarks to State Department employees on Oct. 4, President Bush spoke warmly of ''stories of Christian and Jewish women alike helping women of cover, Arab-American women, go shop because they're afraid to leave their home.''</p>\n  \n  <p>At a televised news conference a week later, he reprised this ecumenical theme: ''In many cities when Christian and Jewish women learned that Muslim women, women of cover, were afraid of going out of their homes alone . . . they went shopping with them . . . an act that shows the world the true nature of America.'' He repeated that phrase, women of cover, calling ''such an outpouring of compassion . . . such a wonderful example.''</p>\n  \n  <p>The cover is a veil that expresses Muslim piety. The hijab, meaning ''cover, curtain,'' can range from a floral kerchief that leaves the face exposed, to the niqab, abbaya or in Persian, chador, which covers the whole body except the face, to the burka, as worn in Afghanistan, which covers everything. ''To have good hijab'' is a general term meaning ''to be properly covered.'' Some Muslim women believe that the cover need not be worn outside the mosque. The linguistic question: in describing the wearers of the veil, is it women who cover, as the president first used it, or women of cover?</p>\n  \n  <p>Sue Obeidi, at the Muslim Public Affairs Council, uses women who cover, women who wear the scarf and women who wear hijab. She is unfamiliar with women of cover, and I cannot find it on databases.</p>\n  \n  <p>It's possible that the president coined the phrase; if so, it was on the analogy of women of color, a description adopted by many nonwhites. (Though colored people is dated and almost a slur, people of color is not in the least offensive.) The substitution of who with of in the cover category introduces a nice parallel to the woman of color phrase; we'll see if it takes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article ends with the phrase 'we'll see if it takes'.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after more than ten years, what can a native speaker, living in the U.S., say about that expression 'women of cover'.</p>\n\n<p>Paraphrasing Mr Safire's words, <em>did it take</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Google Search shows more than 18,000 hits for \"women of cover\", but for those who live outiside of the U.S. that number says nothing at all but simple leads to this question. </p>\n"},{"id":119166,"title":"What does &quot;colored nurses&quot; mean?","body":"<p>In the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia entry listing the characters from Harper Lee’s 1960 novel, <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em></a>, there is a line that states the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Calpurnia is the Finch family’s housekeeper, whom the children love\n  and Atticus deeply respects (he remarks in her defense that she “never\n  indulged [the children] like most <strong>colored nurses</strong>”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does the line “never indulged [the children] like most <strong>colored nurses</strong>” mean?</p>\n"},{"id":96873,"title":"One meaning of &quot;of course&quot;","body":"<p>Reading that classic of children's literature, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tiptoes-Mischievous-Kitten-Noel-Barr/dp/0721401988\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tiptoes the Mischievous Kitten</a></em> (a Ladybird book from 1949), I started wondering about the phrase \"of course.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of what I think of as the typical use of \"of course\": after getting covered in starch, Tiptoes runs out into the sun where \"of course her fur dried in little stiff points... .\" If you get mixed up in starch, then it's gonna dry your fur in stiff points -- here, <em>of course</em> \"<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/of_course\" rel=\"nofollow\">acknowledges the validity of the associated phrase</a>.\"</p>\n\n<p>But here's another example of \"of course\" that I think of as less typical and this is the one I'm asking about. Tiptoes's owner carefully closes a door, but, the latch being loose, it swings open again. At this point in the narrative, my two young children know that the very worst thing that could happen is that the mischievous kitten comes along, but \"Just then, <em>of course</em>, Tiptoes came silently up the stairs\" (and then all hell breaks loose).</p>\n\n<p>This use of \"of course\" does not <em>acknowledge the validity of the associated phrase</em>: it does not follow from the door swinging open that Tiptoes should happen up the stairs.

Is it any accident that an English book of 1949 reminds me of something my English grandmother (born in 1916) might have said? I don't think I've heard it used amongst my Canadian contemporaries. Do we still hear it today, or has it been replaced by other idioms or even tones of voice? Do we hear it in North America, in Australia, NZ, South Africa, India?
