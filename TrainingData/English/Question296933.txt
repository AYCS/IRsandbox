I imagine that people will be surprised, but when realizing in what context I am using it in, then it will be more understandable and acceptable to use it. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I do not even know the definition of the word due to its vastness in meaning, I always thought it was an exclamation-like word meaning nothing (for it to mean sexual activities is a slang definition, is that not correct?), but used purely for emphasis. What does it first and foremost mean in its original/accurate and/or formal definition? </p>\n\n<p>I also know of another definition of the word \"Fuck,\" which is \"I will fuck you\" as in \"I will defeat you\" (in context of fighting or combat), is that a formal definition as well?
