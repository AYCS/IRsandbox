[{"id":276200,"title":"What is the correct way to write the word &quot;back-end&quot;?","body":"<p>Back-end and front-end are common technical terms nowadays. Traditionally, they are written with a hyphen \"back-end\". Is there a rule in the English language that dictates this to be a correct way to write term, that signifies general single something? Or did it just \"stick\" that way?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification 1:</strong>\nThe proposed answer that discusses when to hyphenate assumes back-end as a compound word. I don't think it is and this am asking this question. Compound words like on-the-fly are comprised of possible standalone words that are all required to describe the phenomenon or thing in question.</p>\n\n<p>Backend is a synonym to server-side, which really is a compound word.
