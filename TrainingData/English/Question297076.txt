It rather has the sense of decency. \"Sei brav\", for instance, would be translated as \"Be a good boy/girl\".</p>\n\n<p>I often struggle with a translation for this word. Now I'm trying to find a good translation for \"brav aussehen\". There's possibly not a single word as it depends on context what <em>brav</em> really conveys, but I'm wondering if there is a word, though.</p>\n\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Im Schlaf sieht er/sie so brav aus.<br>\n  While asleep he/she looks so __.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be said about a child. It kinda implies that it's a naughty child, but while sleeping he/she appears like being a good boy/girl.</p>\n\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sie mag nicht mehr so brav aussehen.<br>\n  She doesn't want to look so __ any more.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be said about a woman that usually wears plain clothes and doesn't attract men, and who likes to change that.</p>\n\n<p>The opposite, I guess, is in both cases <em>naughty</em>. But is there a word that would fit in both sentences above?</p>\n\n<p>I tried finding German synonyms (<em>lieb</em>, <em>anständig</em>) and translating those. The results are \"good\", \"nice\", \"sweet\", \"well-behaved\", \"decent\", \"proper\". It seems to me that none of these words is a good translation.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, while \"good\", generally speaking, is a good translation for <em>brav</em> (cf. good boy/girl), I guess it would differently be understood in both sentences above — good-looking or cute, that is. </p>\n\n<p>Other words, like \"well-behaved\", do only fit in one context. Dictionaries (Oxford, M-W) define that as \"behaving in a polite and correct way\" and to my mind dressing in plain clothes is neither polite nor correct. And the Urban dictionary doesn't have a definition for well-behaved, so I don't think that any slang definition would apply here.  </p>\n\n<p>For the same reasons I dismiss the other words, too.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there a word that would match both contexts? As a matter of course, the sentences do not need to be a verbatim translation; it's fine to rephrase them.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Addendum: In German it's possible to say \"brav wirken\" in both sentences. <em>Wirken</em> means <em>to appear</em>, <em>to seem</em>. I tried to get to a solution by thinking about this alternative.</p>\n\n<p>The translations then would be</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While asleep she appears to be __.<br>\n  She doesn't want to give the impression of being __ any more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I feel like the only way to finish the first sentence is \"to be a good boy/girl\" and I tend to believe that the version with \"to look\" also requires that and, hence, I'm coming to the conclusion that there's no adjective that would fit the role.</p>\n"},{"id":223805,"title":"Correct translation for the light switch for a website","body":"<p>I'm looking for the correct translation for a website (<a href=\"http://www.configurator.simonurmet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.configurator.simonurmet.com/</a>).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/M8mE8.jpg\" alt=\"The object to translate\"></p>\n\n<p>I'd like to refer to the whole object, I don't need the name of each part for now.\nThe \"whole object\" to be configured on the website, as my concept would be composed of just these two pieces: the outer frame, and the button covers; not any hardware or cables behind or mechanical parts of any kind (which will be provided standard by default and mounted later).</p>\n\n<p>The clients will access the website to choose the look&amp;feel ie. colours and materials of the frame and the buttons (and set their wall color to take a look at the contrast).</p>\n\n<p>Does the word \"Light switch\" describe that?

Thus he'll sends you to the internist. The internist will do the examination and send the findings back to the dermatologist. You will then visit the dermatologist again, and he will tell you the findings and/or do some further examinations.</p>\n\n<p>All what happens is that you go once (or if necessary twice) to another doctor at the same premises, who has a different specialty, and later you go back to the first doctor.</p>\n\n<p>In German there are different terms for both kinds of referral/consultation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a) Überweisung -> \"Haben sie einen Überweisungsschein?\" (Do you have a letter of referral?)<br>\n  b) Konsil -> \"Diese Untersuchung wird konsiliarisch durchgeführt.\" (This examination will be conducted [word in question].)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this concept doesn't exist in any English speaking country (and hence, there's no word for it), I think I'm looking for a good term that wouldn't be confused with a regular referral.</p>\n"},{"id":185876,"title":"Pronunciation problem","body":"<p>I am from India.
