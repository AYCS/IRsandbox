I'm curious about how widely this expression is known and used.  Doing a search on that phrase found an entry in Urban Dictionary and then the title of a book.

Here are some examples from that first dialog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We're having a wrap up party for The Misfits about forty years late.\n  Cast and crew only, boss.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"How do you know I'm even here, boss?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"I'm over here, boss! Wait, maybe I'm over here! Or maybe I'm behind\n  you, with a hatchet in my hand...\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"I don't know, boss. You tell me. After all, I didn't crash your\n  party.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"You don't say. Wake up, boss! Who do you think you're dealing with?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Because I like the sound of my own voice... It's not everyday we get\n  visitors, boss!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not living in a country where English is the native language, this sounded odd to me. The player is just meeting him for the first time, and he doesn't have any relationship with Gary that would justify him being treated as a boss. It's also not a compliment either, since Gary doesn't really care for him. </p>\n\n<p>I'm guessing it's just his way of talking with people. Maybe this expression is popular somewhere, or maybe it's a throwback to an expression that was popular before. I also checked some online dictionaries, but they don't mention anything about this usage of the word boss.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this: Is this an expression related with a certain place and/or time, or do you think this is a only a random quirk of this character that isn't a reflection of anything historical?</p>\n"},{"id":152941,"title":"Where did the phrase &quot;you&#39;re welcome&quot; come from?","body":"<p>\"You're welcome\" as a response to \"thank you\" makes absolutely no sense.

I noticed this exclamation when I was reading a short story \"the Conscience of the Court\" by Zora Neale Hurston. There was one brown-skinned woman who was charged with felonious and aggravated assault and he exclaimed \"Lawdy me!\" during the court session by musing it inside herself. I haven't found much information on my own search and I know only that Lawd and Lawdy are the non-standard spellings of Lord and Lordy and they have been used in black speech. These two words \"Lawdy\" and \"me\" attached together doesn't make any actual sense for me, but I have my own guessings what they could mean: 1)\"Lord help me!\", 2)more polite and more invisible way to exclaim \"Oh my God\" without referring to direct begging of the God, 3)\"My dear God, forgive me my sins!\" or  4) \"Lawdy me!\" is only an interjection used to express surprise, shock or the strength of feeling in a case that the person is completely non-religious. </p>\n\n<p>So, I'm interested in the meaning, etymology and cultural or religious background of \"Lawdy me!\", where does \"Lawdy me!\" come from and what kind of special meanings or cultural or religious connotations are there behind this exclamation? The reliable resources are also desirable because I didn't found them by myself. Both the religious point of view and the secular point of view are equally welcome.</p>\n"},{"id":172950,"title":"What is the origin of the phrase &quot;do a line with someone&quot;?","body":"<p>What is the origin of the phrase \"do a line with someone\", meaning \"have a regular romantic or sexual romantic relationship with someone\"?</p>\n\n<p>I learnt this phrase from an Irish colleague of mine the other day, but she did not know how the phrase originated.</p>\n\n<p>Oxford dictionaries online say:</p>\n\n<p>Definition of <em>do a line with</em> in English</p>\n\n<p>(Irish and NZ, informal) <em>have a regular romantic or sexual romantic relationship with (someone)</em>: <em>\"I knew if I went home for Christmas, I'd have to pretend I was doing a line with some man.\"</em></p>\n"},{"id":149182,"title":"How did the phrase &quot;hear you out&quot; or &quot;hear me out&quot; come about?","body":"<p>How did the phrase \"hear you out\" or \"hear me out\" come about?</p>\n\n<p>The phrase means \"listen to whatever I have to say before you pass judgment on me,\" or \"tell me whatever you want; I don't mind and won't pass judgment on you.\" </p>\n\n<p>First, why is it \"hear\" and not \"listen\"?</p>\n\n<p>Second, how is the \"out\" used in this context, and what is the purpose of the \"out\"?</p>\n\n<p>Third, how old is this phrase?</p>\n"},{"id":184804,"title":"What&#39;s is the meaning of the phrase &quot;Read it like you&#39;ve written it&quot;?","body":"<p>Does the meaning of the phrase changes on its usage?

How common is this idiom? Is the screen writer mis-using a legitimate idiom?
