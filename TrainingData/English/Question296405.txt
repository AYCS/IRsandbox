[{"id":296405,"title":"Confused about intonation! Will intonation modify the the pronunciation of a word in the dictionary?","body":"<p>This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k80wiT0t2rc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video</a> at <strong>2:55</strong> said that \"<strong>when we have a list, we use rising intonation in each phrase until we get the final item of the list... the final item of the list will have falling intonation</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>Ok, let apply the above rule into this simple question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I love summer, winter, and autumn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In dictionary, <strong>summer</strong> <code>/ˈsʌmər/</code> got stressed at the 1st syllable &amp; <strong>winter</strong> <code>/ˈwɪntər/</code> also got stressed at the 1st syllable</p>\n\n<p>But if we read the above sentence, then I think we have these 2 possibilities:</p>\n\n<p>-do not stress the 1st syllable but do stress the 2nd syllable of <strong>summer</strong> (ie, <code>/sʌˈmər/</code>) &amp; the 2nd syllable of <strong>winter</strong> (ie, <code>/wɪnˈtər/</code>)</p>\n\n<p>-do stress both syllables of <strong>summer</strong> (ie, <code>/ˈsʌˈmər/</code>) &amp; both syllables of <strong>winter</strong> (ie, <code>/ˈwɪnˈtər/</code>)</p>\n\n<p>So, which option is correct? very confused!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extra Info:</strong> In the dictionary, the word \"<strong>instrument</strong>\" <code>/ˈɪnstrəmənt/</code> got stressed at the 1st syllable. However, in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLGJb63mkyA\" rel=\"nofollow\">video</a> at <strong>2:00</strong>, the lady said \"<strong>Do you play other instruments?</strong>\". Since that is the question so we have to use rising intonation for the word \"<strong>instruments</strong>\". And you can see that she stressed the <code>/mənt/</code> so that it sounds like <code>/ɪnstrə'mənt/</code>.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":239687,"title":"Pronunciation of Who is it?","body":"<p>I heard the question \"Who is it?\" in a movie. </p>\n\n<p>[Person A] knocked on a door.</p>\n\n<p>[Person B] came to open the door, but before that he asks \"Who is it?\"</p>\n\n<p>This three syllables question can be pronounced three different ways with different stress patterns.
