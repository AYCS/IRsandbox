Six years later, they'll be meeting in that particular place for the last time because one of them is going to die. In the six year time period, there was a time when they loved each other but now there is just hatred between them.</p>\n\n<p>They decide to meet there. But it's not for old times sake and not for some sentimental value attached to that place. They just wanted to meet over coffee and that happens to be the only coffee shop in their locality so they decide to meet there without giving it much thought. But while the girl is waiting for the guy she realizes that it's the same place where they had their first date (which was nice and sweet but now they only have bitter feelings between them).</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure but I think I could have said that the situation was <em>poignant</em> if two lovers have their first and last date in a particular place. But these people are not lovers anymore. In fact either would be kind of happy if the other died.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":270493,"title":"What word would you use to describe a situation where words are not necessary?","body":"<p>Example: \"Their love was so strong that it was unspoken.

I wanted to separate necessities, or things that we really need from things that we want - or just simply one-off purchases.\nSo then I introduced the word Purchase. So now I have a menu that looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>File\n---New\n------Purchase\n------Expense\n...\n</code></p>\n\n<p>You click on New Purchase if you've just bought something and want to record it (this is a budgeting app). You click on New Expense if you have things to pay for like bills, petrol etc on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure anymore. I've confused the heck out of myself and now I need some help.</p>\n\n<p>Which word would best describe the feature: \"I just <em>purchased</em> something and need a record the details of this transaction\" (Please don't suggest using the actual word Transaction. That word is literally everywhere else.)? And which word would best describe this feature: \"I have some bills and/or items that I buy on a regular basis, and I want to record the details of these future transactions.\"?</p>\n\n<p>Remember: I'm trying to keep them separate. I know I could just use one word for both features, but due to many minor differences in each feature it could be confusing to others and I like a nice and clean interface.</p>\n"},{"id":187104,"title":"Describing a group of people who lie down in a public place to send a political message","body":"<p>I was walking through the square, and I came upon a group of people all lying on the ground.
