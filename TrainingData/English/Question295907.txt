[{"id":295907,"title":"A word for a “troll” who is actually advocating a point of view","body":"<p>The word \"troll\" (in the Internet-related sense) usually means someone who doesn't care about the issues they talk about, but just wants to anger and/or hurt as many people as they can (usually for a perverse sense of power). Now, I have come across many people (online and in person) who have an actual point of view that they are advocating, but who express it in a deliberately abrasive way. Like a troll, they try to hurt and anger people they disagree with, but unlike a troll, they're not trying to hurt anyone they do agree with. Is there a word or term for this?</p>\n\n<p>An example would be a conservative who is trying to hurt, anger, and insult liberals, but not conservatives; or a liberal who is trying to hurt, anger and insult conservatives, but not liberals.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":287667,"title":"Is there a single word for “one who explains his point of view very clearly”?","body":"<p>I am looking for a single word for a person who is able to explain himself very clearly and using the best possible words, etc.\nI am not looking for \"perspicuous\", etc. The focus is more on the language part: someone who uses the right language and words to describe himself.\nI know the word exists but its just skipping my head at the moment!!!\nPlease help.</p>\n"},{"id":273216,"title":"A word for a person who talks themselves up but actually does nothing","body":"<p>What do you call someone who talks themselves up but actually does nothing?</p>\n"},{"id":265070,"title":"Word for someone who is jovial, but malicious?","body":"<p>I'm working on designing characters for a game, and the main group of villains consists of characters that have a two-word epithet in the form \"The ___\" where the word in the blank describes their personality or what they do (i.e. \"The Languid,\" \"The Reminder,\" etc.)</p>\n\n<p>One of these characters acts like a trickster/jester, but in an uncanny and rather malicious way.
