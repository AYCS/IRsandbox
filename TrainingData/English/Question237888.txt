It means you really get into a problem or some work. And you won't give up till it's resolved. I've been looking all over the web, but I've not been able to find an expression that comes close enough. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way of saying this en English? The Dutch expression is a verb phrase, so that would probably come closest.  </p>\n\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n\n<p>Thank you all very much for your answers:). Since I can only accept one final answer, I feel the need to do some clarification. Initially I added the single word request, since the expression in Dutch is just one word (not including the preposition). However, that's very specific to the Dutch language and I'm mostly looking for an expression that comes closest. Therefore I feel that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>to get one's teeth into</code> Comes closest, it's actually almost an exact translation both literally and in meaning.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>indefatigable</code> Is the best candidate when a single word is required(although the literal translation in dutch for this would be 'onvermoeibaar'). This also is an interesting choice since vastbijten can be used as noun(<code>vastbijter</code>), meaning an indefatigable person. </p></li>\n<li><p><code>to dig in</code> Would be probably the American equivalent of to get one's teeth into. Also not one word, but approaching the meaning closest.</p></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":237429,"title":"What do you call someone who","body":"<p>What would you call a person who gains a sense of godlikeness, but uses their knowledge and omnipotence for what they feel is the good of others?
