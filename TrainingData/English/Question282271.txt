[{"id":282271,"title":"The two uses of &quot;be&quot;","body":"<p>I am reading a book about English verbs.  The first chapter gives some basic definitions, and said that \"be\" can be used as a lexical verb and as an auxilliary verb.  For example: \"I am tall\" or \"I am running\"; or \"He is happy\" or \"He is reading\".</p>\n\n<p>My question has several parts:</p>\n\n<p>1) Why can the \"be\" verb be used in these different ways?</p>\n\n<p>2) Why does English require this \"helping\" verb for the progressive tenses.  When you think about it, what is it really \"helping?\"  It seems only useful in the sense of distinguishing the simple tenses from the progressives.  Why not say \"I now read\" or \"I now reading\" and use \"now\" or some other word as the \"helper?\"</p>\n\n<p>3) When you say \"I am [word],\" you are saying the subject has this quality, is in this state of being, or is the word.  For example \"I am tall,\" means you have this characteristic, \"I am sad,\" means you are in this state of being, and \"I am a fireman\" means that you and fireman are the same.  So, if you say \"I am reading,\" it seems that you are somehow saying that you and the activity of reading (the gerund sense of the word) are the same.  There seems to be a kind of relationship between you and \"reading.\"  Is this what's really going on but is just invisible to must of us?  Is there some history to the use of \"be\" that addresses this (or is this more related to the development of \"ing\" in English?)</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":241766,"title":"How did &quot;lobster&quot; mean two different species?","body":"<p>This live crustacean is called <em>astice</em> in Italian.

The Italian dictionary describes the <a href=\"http://www.garzantilinguistica.it/ricerca/?q=astice\">astice</a> as having a deep (intense) blue colour (<em>turchino</em>) with yellow splotches and <strong>large claws</strong>, whereas the <a href=\"http://www.garzantilinguistica.it/ricerca/?q=aragosta\">aragosta</a> has a reddish body, five pairs of legs, long antennae and an incredibly hard shell that covers its body and head. To me it looks like a giant insect. In English, however, they are both called <em>lobster</em> and if you eat lobster in either a British or an American restaurant, they will often present you with an <em>astice</em>. An article in the London <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/restaurants/londons-new-lobster-restaurants-9865084.html\">Evening Standard</a> clearly shows the restaurateur (an Italian!) with two large ‘astices’ in his hands. :))</p>\n\n<p>I don't care which species they give me, frankly they're both delicious, but if I were to invite an Italian friend to a Boston restaurant and order lobster for both of us, she might be dismayed at seeing an <em>astice</em> on her plate. </p>\n\n<p>The Italian term <em>astice</em> is derived from <em>άστακός</em> (astakós); Greek for <em>prawn</em> or <em>lobster</em> (which one exactly is unclear). <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astakos\">Astakos</a> is also the name of a Greek fishing bay.</p>\n\n<p>The Online Etymological Dictionary says (emphasis mine)  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lobster\">lobster</a></strong> (n.) marine shellfish, Old English <em>loppestre</em> \"lobster, locust,\" corruption of Latin <em>locusta</em>, lucusta \"lobster, <strong>locust</strong>,\" by influence of Old English <em>loppe</em> \"spider,\" a variant of <em>lobbe</em>. The ending of Old English l<em>oppestre</em> is the fem. agent noun suffix (as in <em>Baxter</em>, <em>Webster</em>; see <em><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-ster&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\">-ster</a></em>), which approximated the Latin sound. [. . .] \n  OED says the Latin word originally meant \"lobster or some similar crustacean, the application to the locust being suggested by the resemblance in shape.\" <strong><em>Locusta</em></strong> in the sense \"lobster\" also appears in French (<em>langouste</em> now \"crawfish, crayfish,\" but in Old French \"lobster\" and \"locust;\" a 13c. psalter has God giving over the crops of Egypt to the <em>langoustes</em>) and Old Cornish (<em>legast</em>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RijyB.jpg\" alt=\"picture of a cooked lobster on a plate with lemon slices\"></p>\n\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why is there only one term in English for these two different species?</li>\n<li>To me the Boston \"black\" lobster (<em>astice</em>) looks more like a scarab beetle or a crab than a locust.

However, this translation of the word <strong>phenomenal</strong> from English to Chinese is getting popular. And it becomes one of those new internet words that no Chinese reader truly understands but they sort of get it just because they have seen it many times in the same context of praising an exceptional performance of some player.</p>\n\n<p>Initially I laughed at the translation. It must be a joke, I thought. Someone started this not knowing phenomenal means \"exceptional, especially impressive, fantastic\". But to my surprise, this translated word sticks and its Chinese version is being reused more and more popularly by the day, especially in online text. And most of these usages were not in the context of a translated English text but original writing in Chinese. I have seen more and more main stream Chinese media start to use the (Chinese version) word as if it is an accepted Chinese word. </p>\n\n<p>This makes me wonder. And I actually looked it up in the online English dictionary. To my surprise, two meanings of the word <strong>phenomenal</strong> were given.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Of, relating to, or constituting phenomena or a phenomenon.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>Extraordinary; outstanding</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I was not aware of the first meaning before this. Now my new theory is the translation at word level is OK. But given the context, the second translation should be picked instead of the first one.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the first translator looked up the word in a English-to-Chinese dictionary and picked the first translation. He might be in a hurry and did not do proof-reading and no one questioned him. Apparently the second meaning should be picked in the context. (EDIT: or maybe the dictionary he used did not have the Chinese version of the second meaning) Maybe a lot of careless translators did this in a long period of time, and in the end the Chinese readers sort of accepted the word.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the question here is if the two meanings are sort of related, or the second meaning (which is more popular in English writings I assume) is derived somehow from the first meaning.
