[{"id":118720,"title":"‘Sought’ or ‘sought-after’?","body":"<p>In the context of a computation, I would like to refer to “the sought value”. I think this is the most precise and terse formulation. However, I have noticed that people often use “sought-after” rather than “sought” in some similar situations. I could certainly say “the sought-after value”, but it’s a bit clumsier, especially if it isn’t necessary. Dictionary entries for ‘seek’ don’t seem to indicate that a preposition should be necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, “the value sought” or “the value sought after” (again, which is best?) could do the trick, and perhaps that’s better English in general, but in my mathematical context, I think the precise meaning gets through more clearly when I use ‘sought’ in an adjective-like manner.</p>\n\n<p>So, is my preferred formulation “the sought value” kosher, or should I modify it with a preposition or otherwise?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":280417,"title":"Grammatical usage of prepositions: before or after &quot;not only ....but also....&quot;","body":"<p>Which one is more universal, before or after \"not only...but also...\"?  </p>\n\n<p>I saw a sentence in an article: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...masters were responsible not only <strong>for</strong> teaching their apprentices\n  a trade <strong>but also <em>for</em> providing</strong> them some education...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I thought omitting the second \"for\" would be fine: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...masters were responsible <strong>for</strong> not only teaching their apprentices\n  a trade <strong>but also providing</strong> them some education...</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":290153,"title":"&quot;Twice in&quot; ? can preposition be used after twice?","body":"<p>Which is the correct sentence:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He goes to museum twice a week </li>\n<li>He goes to museum twice in a week</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":283819,"title":"Preposition after conclude","body":"<p>If the police conclude that the person died by accident, should I say 'The police concluded in an accident' ?</p>\n\n<p>To me, this sounds like they finish the story by having an accident.</p>\n"},{"id":5713,"title":"Which prepositions should I use after &quot;do your best&quot;?","body":"<p>I always have been having problems how to understand which preposition to use.
