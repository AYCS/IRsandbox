I am a bit confused about all the terms used to describe books written about English.  For example, \"usage\", \"style\", \"reference\", \"reference grammars\", etc.  So I don't know what the proper term is for the type of book I want to ask about.</p>\n\n<p>So I've seen the thread on English reference grammars (english.stackexchange.com/questions/183/what-are-some-of-the-better-english-reference-grammars), and my question is similar.  That thread asks about texts that describe English grammar, but I'm wondering about more practical books.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when I'm writing, I often come up with a myriad of questions like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When should one use \"that\" vs. \"which\"?</li>\n<li>How do you deal with multiple descriptive clause modifiers, or whatever they're called, that both end with nouns, leading to ambiguity.  For example: \"I looked at the bucket at the bottom of the barrel that contained my money.\"  Let's say that the bucket is the object that contains the money, not the barrel.  Well if you say \"the bucket that contained my money at the bottom of the barrel\" that could still be ambiguous, because now maybe \"at the bottom of the barrel\" could refer to the money.  This is a bad example, but you get the gist of it; how do you deal with these double-bind ambiguities?</li>\n<li>Is it grammatical to do a comma then a gerund phrase like I just did in that last bullet point?  For example: \"This drug is fatal, causing death within seconds.\" Is that grammatical?</li>\n<li>When should one put hyphens between nouns?</li>\n<li>Is it grammatical to use nouns as adjectives?  E.g. \"double-bind ambiguities\".  There's probably a better way to say that, right?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And so on and so on.  Now, one could ask/search for every single question that pops into your head on this stack exchange, but that seems infeasible for a large volume.  So there must be some reference book that would give one the background to know the answer to these types of questions.  After all, the people on this stack exchange had to learn it somewhere, right?</p>\n"},{"id":66037,"title":"&quot;I hope this could help you&quot; vs. &quot;I hope it can help you&quot; vs. &quot;Hoped this may help you&quot;","body":"<p>Which of the following is grammatical when giving someone something they want?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>I hope this could help you.</li>\n  <li>I hope it can help you.</li>\n  <li>Hoped this may help you.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":129554,"title":"&quot;needs closed&quot; and &quot;needing closed&quot;","body":"<p>\"Needs closed\", \"needs resolved\", \"needs done\"...
