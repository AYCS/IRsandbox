It rather has the sense of decency. \"Sei brav\", for instance, would be translated as \"Be a good boy/girl\".</p>\n\n<p>I often struggle with a translation for this word. Now I'm trying to find a good translation for \"brav aussehen\". There's possibly not a single word as it depends on context what <em>brav</em> really conveys, but I'm wondering if there is a word, though.</p>\n\n<p>Example 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Im Schlaf sieht er/sie so brav aus.<br>\n  While asleep he/she looks so __.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be said about a child. It kinda implies that it's a naughty child, but while sleeping he/she appears like being a good boy/girl.</p>\n\n<p>Example 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sie mag nicht mehr so brav aussehen.<br>\n  She doesn't want to look so __ any more.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be said about a woman that usually wears plain clothes and doesn't attract men, and who likes to change that.</p>\n\n<p>The opposite, I guess, is in both cases <em>naughty</em>. But is there a word that would fit in both sentences above?</p>\n\n<p>I tried finding German synonyms (<em>lieb</em>, <em>anständig</em>) and translating those. The results are \"good\", \"nice\", \"sweet\", \"well-behaved\", \"decent\", \"proper\". It seems to me that none of these words is a good translation.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, while \"good\", generally speaking, is a good translation for <em>brav</em> (cf. good boy/girl), I guess it would differently be understood in both sentences above — good-looking or cute, that is. </p>\n\n<p>Other words, like \"well-behaved\", do only fit in one context. Dictionaries (Oxford, M-W) define that as \"behaving in a polite and correct way\" and to my mind dressing in plain clothes is neither polite nor correct. And the Urban dictionary doesn't have a definition for well-behaved, so I don't think that any slang definition would apply here.  </p>\n\n<p>For the same reasons I dismiss the other words, too.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there a word that would match both contexts? As a matter of course, the sentences do not need to be a verbatim translation; it's fine to rephrase them.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Addendum: In German it's possible to say \"brav wirken\" in both sentences. <em>Wirken</em> means <em>to appear</em>, <em>to seem</em>. I tried to get to a solution by thinking about this alternative.</p>\n\n<p>The translations then would be</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While asleep she appears to be __.<br>\n  She doesn't want to give the impression of being __ any more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I feel like the only way to finish the first sentence is \"to be a good boy/girl\" and I tend to believe that the version with \"to look\" also requires that and, hence, I'm coming to the conclusion that there's no adjective that would fit the role.</p>\n"},{"id":270696,"title":"How do I translate “Zwangsrouter”?","body":"<p>I tried to translate Zwangsrouter to English, but couldn't think of a proper translation.

A \"Zwangsrouter\" is a router which was given to the customer by the ISP and is not optional. Usually all routers by ISPs are optional if you have the login data for your voice over ip connection and your dsl connection. But some ISPs won't give you the login data, just a preconfigured router which you are forced to use. You cannot update the router (usually), may have to rent it for a fee and are still in charge for security risks (german law) as it stands in your household. Also, this device (not owned by you) takes space and power you have to pay for despite the fact you didn't want this router (just the line). This is why this router is called \"Zwangsrouter\" - you are being forced to use it.</p>\n"},{"id":259759,"title":"Translation of a German word: &quot;Gutmensch&quot;","body":"<p>The word \"Gutmensch\" consists of</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>gut = good</li>\n<li>Mensch = human</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sounds like a compliment but actually the word is very insulting.</p>\n\n<p>It describes someone who (for example)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>is not able to take criticism, since their cause is always just</li>\n<li>considers objective arguments as inconsiderate and hurtful</li>\n<li>instinctively tries to control any dispute and calm the situation</li>\n<li>suffers ostentatively at the slightest indignation</li>\n<li>scorns at dark humour</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The list is not exhaustive, I'm just trying to convey the right frame of mind.</p>\n\n<p>There is this sense of entitlement and an attitude like that of a teacher.

I don't think I heard this before. Seems rather constructed to me.</li>\n<li>goody two-shoes : I definitely didn't hear this before</li>\n<li>starry eyed idealist : someone who is blinded by his ideals. The greenpeace activist from my example would probably be a starry eyed idealist. But that's not necessarily bad.</li>\n<li>good mind : the dictionary says this is derogatory. But it seems rather harmless to me. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would you say \"He is such a good mind\" about one of your friends ? Sarcastically, I mean ?
