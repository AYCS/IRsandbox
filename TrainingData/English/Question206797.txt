In fact, this example is the reason why I am asking! I am blending a quote taken from a book into an assignment on which I am currently working. (Don't worry, I am not asking you to do my homework. This assignment is for Middle Eastern Studies, not English class.) I was originally planning to write the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ottoman sultan had \"political rivals and sectarian challengers. . . . At the turn of the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, the Ottomans had two Muslim neighbors\": the Mamluk sultanate of Egypt and Persia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The final few words are what confuses me. The Mamluk sultanate of Egypt is a different entity from Persia. Most reasonable people realize this, and the fact that I wrote that there were <em>two</em> Muslim neighbors makes this even more clear. However, it is possible to interpret the phrase \"the Mamluk sultanate of Egypt and Persia\" as meaning a single sultanate ruling over both Egypt and Persia. I realize that I could easily avoid this by switching the places of \"the Mamluk sultanate of Egypt\" and \"Persia,\" but, for reasons of parallelism with other parts of my paper, I cannot do this.</p>\n\n<p>This specific example is not much of a problem. I could solve it in a variety of different ways. Rather, I am asking how one could solve the general problem of making sure that when a prepositional phrase is followed by a noun, the word \"and,\" and another noun which is not an object of that prepositional phrase, that that second noun is not interpreted as being an object of that prepositional phrase, for I have noticed this problem crop up numerous times before.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"id":284183,"title":"Noun phrases used as adverbs","body":"<p>Example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I fell in love <strong>the moment I saw her</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this considered grammatical as it is, or is it some kind of ellipsis?</p>\n"},{"id":278724,"title":"How do I express &quot;create new if [this data] does not already exist&quot;?","body":"<p>I'm programming and want to create a variable only if it does not already exist.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to express this with a single word?</p>\n\n<p>For example, if the variable already exists, I have the options </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>overwrite</em> to overwrite the current value with a new value</li>\n<li><em>append</em> to append new data to existing data</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm searching for the word to express <em>if the data already exists, leave it alone, otherwise take the given data</em>.</p>\n"},{"id":237680,"title":"Preposition before noun phrases","body":"<p>I have asked the same question in ELL stackexchange, but unfortunately haven't received enough answer/comment. The one answer I got is not satisfactory. So that's the reason I am asking it here again. <a href=\"http://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/52831/preposition-before-noun-phrases\">Link to ELL post</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have seen in some cases prepositions are omitted before some noun phrases. And it's explained that those phrases are actually an adverb phrases. But I know a simple thing. If the head of the phrase is a noun, it's a noun phrase. If the head of the phrase is an adverb it is an adverb phrase.</p>\n\n<p>For example -</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Look <strong>both ways</strong> before crossing the road. [<strong>both ways</strong> is a noun phrase, where the head is <strong>ways</strong>, but still there is no preposition.]</p></li>\n  <li><p>He approached me <em>in</em> <strong>a friendly way</strong>. [<strong>a friendly way</strong> is a noun phrase, where the head is <strong>way</strong>, but as expected unlike sentence #1 it's preceded by the preposition <strong>in</strong>. And I have never seen this phrase is used without a preposition. I believe dropping the preposition is wrong, according to the grammar.]</p></li>\n  <li><p>She made a pickle <strong>a different way</strong> from her mother. [<strong>a different way</strong> is a noun phrase, where the head is <strong>way</strong>, but strangely there is no preposition before it. But I have seen examples of <strong>a different way</strong> used both with prepositions and without prepositions. I think the preposition here is optional.]</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now from these example sentences I have tried to demonstrate my problem/confusing area. My question is - </p>\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> When a noun phrase is used as an adverb phrase?</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> When before a noun phrase the placement of preposition is obligatory (like sentence #2)? And where it's optional (like sentence #3)?
