I also hear the simple past tense used in instances in which I was taught to use the past perfect tense.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a widespread trend, to use the past perfect construction as a past tense construction, and to use the past tense instead of the past perfect tense to indicate action that precedes the past action that has just been mentioned? </p>\n\n<p>Examples are</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Before I met her I heard about her</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>instead of</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Before I met her I had heard about her</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I had heard about her yesterday for the first time.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither Microsoft Word nor WordPerfect likes it when I use the string <em>had had</em>.

However, a procession of <em>had</em>, <em>had</em>, <em>had</em> makes writing sound clumsy and labored, especially in a narrative.  I treat past perfect similar to constructions using <em>that</em>: Unless it changes the meaning of a sentence, toss it out.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>A</strong>: She had called me weeks earlier, and now I remembered what she had told me.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>B</strong>: She called me weeks earlier, and now I remembered what she told me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong> is strictly correct grammar, but <em>weeks earlier</em> already implies that the phone call happened before my remembering it, so I would favor simple past tense (<strong>B</strong>).

Many sources say that we only need to use the past perfect when the sequence of events is not clear without it. Also, they say that we do have to use the past perfect tense every time you mention two things that happened in the past. But many examples that are given about the tense include something like this: \"I <strong>had switched off</strong> the lights before I went to bed\" or \"after they <strong>had had</strong> breakfast, they left for the park\".
