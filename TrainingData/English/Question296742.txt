Trope, reference, and allusion are very broad terms. More important, they don't actually describe <em>the act of slightly altering a phrase,</em> and instead are describing the mere mention of a phrase. Snowclone is not correct because a snowclone describes a <em>template</em> based on an idiom.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":237068,"title":"What is it called when someone uses a slightly absurd specific example of something to be humorous?","body":"<p>For example, \"We're competing for attention with teenagers who would rather be playing Angry Birds,\" or \"You need to explain this in a way that your grandmother who thinks the internet works by magic would understand.\" </p>\n\n<p>What these really mean is, \"We're competing for attention with teenagers who would rather be playing on their mobile phones or doing something else\", and \"You need to explain this in a way that anyone would understand, even if they don't understand how the internet works at all.\" </p>\n\n<p>The speaker has no idea whether the other person's grandmother understands the internet or is even alive.
