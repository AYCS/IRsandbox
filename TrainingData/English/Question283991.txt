I thought of \"intergenerational cooperation\" but wouldn't the word \"intergenerational\" imply that it refers to cooperation between of e.g. a 20-year-old and a 80-year-old living in the same times?

It makes a lot of sense to those who know that in programming you can easily turn some part of the code (usually a line) into simply a comment that would have no bearing on the code's execution. For example,</p>\n\n<pre><code>print: Hello world \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can be easily turned into a comment in this way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>; print: Hello world  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Programmers would say in this case, \"I have commented out the line.\" It is absolutely logical and makes sense to me. However, I wonder if this phrasal verb ever was used before the programming came about. Did it exist in those times? If yes, in what situation it was normally used then? </p>\n"}]}]
