Basically, are these always compatible (i.e., one can be used in place of the other), or is it preferable to use one in place of the other in some situations?<br>\nFor instance, is it best to use \"this\" in literary words, and \"such\" in scientific works such science articles and law manuscripts? Personally, when I hear the word \"this\", I see it as contrasting with the word \"that\", and I always envision someone pointing at something.<br>\nOn the other hand, the word \"such\" seems more abstract, and thus more appropriate when referring to intangible things. I would also consider the word \"this\" more appropriate when referring to something tangible, such as an article, or to the main topic of conversation, whereas I would tend to use \"such\" more often in longer sentences where it can be used to refer to subtopics, perhaps in conjunction with the word \"this\" serving the same purpose, so that the two can be contrasted.<br>\nI wonder whether there are also cases where it would be better to choose one word rather than the other, and what the criteria would be for such choice in such cases.</p>\n"},{"id":6,"title":"When did &quot;while&quot; and &quot;whilst&quot; become interchangeable?","body":"<p>I think most folk happily use either \"while\" or \"whilst\".
