(That is, what does actually “putting a wrinkle on a horn” entail? Does it mean wrenching an animal's—say, a bull's or a ram's—horn out of shape? Or something else?)</p></li>\n  <li><p>What is its figurative meaning?</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My initial impression is that the phrase figuratively means something like \"throw one for a loop,\" but that inference is based entirely on the context supplied by the three examples given below. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><em>Preliminary Research</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In an Ngram-based Google Books search of the years 1700–1900, the earliest instance of this idiomatic phrase occurs in Thomas Halliburton, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=m_sNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=%22put+a+wrinkle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d35SVN79HJG2oQSIp4C4BQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22put%20a%20wrinkle%22&amp;f=false\"><em>The Clockmaker; or The Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick of Slickville</em></a> (1838), where a Yankee-dialect speaker is being \"quoted\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yes, said he, so I have often heerd tell ; and I have heerd, too, that the new ones [packet ships] won't lay to, and the old ones won't scud ; grand chance in a gale for  feller that, ain't it?

Ballantyne, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=q3ZBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22put+a+wrinkle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iYdSVOvaNcTnoASZ_YBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22put%20a%20wrinkle%22&amp;f=false\"><em>The Gorilla Hunters: A Tale of the Wilds of Africa</em></a> (1861):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“ Look here, you naturalist, and I'll <strong>put a wrinkle on your horn</strong>.
