One of them said something along the line of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A white lie is a small lie told with the intention of not hurting the listener.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This goes in line with what's on the corresponding wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#White_lie\" rel=\"nofollow\">page</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>White lies are minor lies which could be considered to be harmless, or even beneficial, in the long term.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, me and another native speaker thought that white lie is something different:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A white lie is when you still tell <em>a</em> truth, but in such a way that you still conceal what you wanted to conceal without actually telling falsehood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then I remembered that I've seen this definition before from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curious_Incident_of_the_Dog_in_the_Night-Time\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</a>, at the beginning of chapter 79:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I got home Father was sitting at the table in the kitchen and he had made my supper.
