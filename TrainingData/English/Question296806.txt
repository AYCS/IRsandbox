So any help is appreciated. There are may other repeated words that I've found but I don't have much trouble changing them to something better. I'm at 89k words here and every few days I do a book wide edit to cut out the fat. So if you've got a better way to describe say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>She <em>looked</em> down at the table as she couldn't stand his wintry gaze.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All ideas are good; I just need a spring board to get the idea train chugging.
