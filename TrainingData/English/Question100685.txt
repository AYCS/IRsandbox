Will that title make my customers feel intimidated?</p>\n\n<p>My brother and I had a long argument about that word. I said that the word doesn't make such a bad meaning and it can be used anywhere in a friendly manner; but he said that it sounds derogatory and should be avoided.

Does \"slight\" come with negative connotations? It can be used negatively, but does it default to the negative? The movie \"Her\" marketed itself as being set \"in the slight future\". Is this supposed to refer to a many sci-fi movies' obsession with futuristic dystopias or does it literally just mean being nearer to now than \"in the near future\"?</p>\n"},{"id":255195,"title":"Does the word &#39;clique&#39; have a negative connotation?","body":"<p>Say I am offering a sharing service where people can exchange ideas and information through a simple interface.
