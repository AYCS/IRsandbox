[{"id":142299,"title":"Problem listening to foreign accents","body":"<p>From the beginning I had some problems listening to foreign accents. Like when someone from my native country (India) speaks English I understand it at once, but if someone from a foreign country especially US speaks English, I have to make them repeat the sentence several times to understand it. Also, I have noticed I have more problems when watching movies, talking than when  watching lectures. I am having lot of trouble these days because of it.</p>\n\n<p>So how can I solve this problem?

Weller's dialogue is written somewhat phonetically, I presume, but I'm struggling to understand what accent Dickens is trying to portray. The main peculiarities of Weller's speech are using \"v\" where there should be a \"w\" and a \"w\" when there should be a \"v\". For example, he says \"wery\" instead of \"very\" and \"avay\" instead of \"away\". Weller is supposed to be from London, but this doesn't seem like any kind of London accent I've heard.
