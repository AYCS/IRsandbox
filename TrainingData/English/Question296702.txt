In my current book was written that someone \"... was three days dying.\" Does this mean that the person died three days ago, or that the person has been suffering from mortal wounds for three days but is still holding on?\nThe previous chapter with this person ended in him being on fire, but there was nothing said about whether he died. The next chapter about this person started with: \"The (...) prince was three days dying.\"</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks for all the help. After this I read further and it became more clear that indeed the Prince was dead after three days of suffering. <br>\nTo answer some of your questions, it is not translated, as a matter of fact, the writer was born in New Jersey. He is known to write a bit archaic though.<br>\nIt could indeed well mean the writer wanted to emphasize his suffering since later in the book, someone who was had a long life of seeing people die, described it as one of the worst things he ever saw.<br>\nAnd furthermore, I left out where the prince was from, to prevent spoilers.

I've sorted through \"noun\" + \"adjective\" search results here on SE, but found nothing approximating what I'm after.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to think of an example of a word that means something like \"person/role who is so closely associated with adjective X that there is a specific word for such a person/role\". In other words, it's a noun that's the quintessence of an adjective + verb combination. In particular, I'm after adjectives closely related to emotional states, but with nuances about behavior&nbsp;— such as \"uninhibited\" in the context of being direct and not backing down when challenged about one's wishes.</p>\n\n<p>For example, \"person who is courageous\". Which I can't think of a noun for. Edit: I found one! <em>Braver</em> is an adjective-verb (\"exhibiting greater courage; facing danger/pain/fear courageously\"), and a noun (\"one who acts bravely\"); where the noun is so closely tied to the adjective and verb senses that it's an embodiment. This kind of noun is exactly what I'm looking for.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ingenue</em> is close to the type of word I'm looking for, as it's a noun closely associated with several characteristics&nbsp;— some of which are descriptive of personality or emotions.</p>\n\n<p>For comparison, consider \"person who repels enemy attacks\" as being <em>defender</em>. (What I'd describe as a verb giving rise to a noun.)</p>\n\n<p>We have these kinds of words for psychological states in some cases (e.g. \"manic\" for someone with very high energy, erratic behavior&nbsp;— which is indicative of psychological struggles), in which the word seems to be a mix of noun, adjective, and verb.
