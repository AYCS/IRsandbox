As Vice \n  Premier, we expect her to be consistently well informed on \n  issues and very clear about the policy positions that the \n  Chen Administration will stake out.  She is the kind of \n  lawyer most skilled at finding reasons not to do things. \n  As the person who started Taiwan's push for a Free Trade \n  Agreement with the U.S., we can expect that she will \n  continue this effort and push even harder in light of the \n  July 2007 expiration of trade negotiating authority. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(source: <a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06TAIPEI221_a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06TAIPEI221_a.html</a> )</p>\n\n<p>And I don't quite understand the meaning of that sentence: <code>She is the kind of \nlawyer most skilled at finding reasons not to do things.</code></p>\n\n<p>Below are some possibilities:</p>\n\n<p>(A) She is lazy and has a lot of excuses running away from things that she should do.</p>\n\n<p>(B) She is good at distinguishing things she should or shouldn't do.</p>\n\n<p>(C) When there's something she thinks is unnecesary, she is very good at telling others reasons not to do that.</p>\n\n<p>(D) It probably is a typo.
