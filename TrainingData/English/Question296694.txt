[{"id":296694,"title":"Book is to &quot;booklet&quot; as hand is to...?","body":"<p>In many languages, formation of diminutives by adding suffixes is a productive part of the language. Many languages apply a grammatical diminutive to nouns, a few—including Dutch,  Italian and Russian for instance—also use it for adjectives. </p>\n\n<p>In English, noun diminutives (mainly in the sense of a smaller version of something)   are generally formed by using adjectives. A common exception, among a few others, is the usage of the suffix: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-let&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">-let</a></em></strong>: </p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>diminutive word-forming element, Middle English, from Old French <em>-elet</em>. </p>\n  \n  <p>from which, <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=booklet\" rel=\"nofollow\">booklet (n.)</a></em></strong></p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why are diminutives in English not always formed by adding a suffix, like in French for instance? </li>\n<li>Why can't a suffix like <em>-let</em> be applied to everday terms like <em>hand</em> or <em>car</em>?

He explained it quite well that one should have a look at the meaning of the word to discern of how many components it consists. His example was 'unfearful' and it was easy to understand why fearful was formed first, after which the prefix un- can be added.</p>\n\n<p>So, now I ask, what happens if you have a word like 'unhappier' which in my analysis consists of the adjective happy, a suffix for the comparative and a prefix for the negation. Is there any way to analyse whether unhappy or happier was formed first? Or is this a stupid question, because the comparative does not create a now word per se, rather changes it's grammatical function?</p>\n"},{"id":145028,"title":"Shake hands or shake hand?","body":"<p>Which one of the following phrases is correct?</p>\n\n<p><em>I will <strong>shake hands</strong> with him</em> OR <em>I will <strong>shake hand</strong> with him</em>.</p>\n"},{"id":279513,"title":"Commas in introducing book title","body":"<p>Is a comma needed here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am seeking representation for my recent novel, <em>A Better Song</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":240271,"title":"Are some grammar rules different for Latin origin nouns with the ‑ion suffix?","body":"<p>Two questions on ELL.SE, <a href=\"http://ell.stackexchange.com/q/53699/9161\">one involving the word division</a> and the <a href=\"http://ell.stackexchange.com/q/49636/9161\">other about the word implementation</a>, made me realize that I treat these words differently without really understanding the grammatical reason. </p>\n\n<p>The first question from ELL is about the use of conceptually in this definition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>dualism = {mass noun} 1. <strong>The division of something conceptually</strong> into two opposed or contrasted aspects, or the state of being so divided</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Division\" looks like a noun that would need an adjective like \"conceptual\" to describe it, but here we are using an adverb. I intuitively feel like that's OK for this particular word, where it isn't OK for a noun like \"book\". </p>\n\n<p>The second question from ELL is about the lack of an article in front of \"implementation\" in this sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tusk said the EU would go ahead anyway with new sanctions against 19 Russian and Ukrainian individuals and nine entities next week, despite having agreed on Monday <strong>to suspend implementation</strong> for a week to boost the chances of success of the Minsk talks.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Intuitively, I think it's fine to say either \"suspend the implementation\" or \"suspend implementation\", but again, I'm unsure of my grammatical footing here. </p>\n\n<p>In the second question, the asker thought that if you could substitute a related gerund form into the sentence and it still made sense grammatically, the original word might follow some special set of grammar rules. It seems to me that the Latin suffix <em>‑ion</em> (denoting action or condition) is the key feature of these words.</p>\n\n<p>Do these words that can be both an action and a state or condition actually have special treatment grammatically, or has common usage made some grammatically incorrect usages seem OK? </p>\n"},{"id":189933,"title":"&quot;A book to be read&quot; vs &quot;a book to read&quot;","body":"<p>Which is grammatically correct: \"a book to be read\" or \"a book to read\"?\nAnd what is the difference?</p>\n"},{"id":116517,"title":"Usage of &quot;booked on&quot; &quot;booked in&quot; and &quot;booked for&quot;?","body":"<p>Which usage is correct in terms of booking a room/course/session?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"booked on a room/course/session\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"booked in a room/course/session\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"booked for a room/course/session\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Googling it, I usually see all three versions for crime-related headlines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/13/jason-peters-arrested-drag-racing_n_3434173.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Booked On Assault Charge</a></p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Man-booked-in-car-crash-that-killed-wife-son-4589126.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Man booked in car crash that killed wife, son</a></p>\n  \n  <p>Booked For Alleged Drag Racing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am wondering if this is a regional choice, like \"standing in line\" vs. \"standing on line.\"</p>\n"},{"id":138793,"title":"What is the &quot;oldest joke in the book?&quot;","body":"<p>What is the earliest recorded joke in a published work in the English language?</p>\n"},{"id":151262,"title":"what book to read &amp; which book to read","body":"<p>In the absence of a clear context regarding how known or unknown is the number of books available for me to read, should I use <em>what book to read</em> or <em>which book to read</em>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't know <em>what</em> book to read (= I don't know how many books there\n  are for me to choose from.)</p>\n  \n  <p>I don't know <em>which</em> book to read (= I know how many books there are\n  for me to choose from, and choose one from that specified number.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are these assumptions correct or not?
