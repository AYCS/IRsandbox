[{"id":296847,"title":"Can “dystopian” be accurate for artistic works based largely on truth?","body":"<p>For example: It seems to me a bit sketchy to categorize the movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others\"><em>The Lives of Others (2006)</em></a> as such, even though it is a work of fiction and set in a <em>negative world</em> - - because it is largely based on East German surveillance that really happened.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, it would seem ~any~ [art loves to find cracks] possible historic, artistic permutation of Nazi Germany can't really be accurately called “dystopian”.

Does/should the subsequently minted <em>dystopia</em> have the same general exactitude?</p>\n\n<p>So, we should not be hearing about “dystopian” novels and movies <strong><em>set in the present or past</em></strong> unless they are set in an imaginary <em>alternate universe</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Am I completely wrong in this understanding?
