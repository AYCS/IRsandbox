[{"id":296578,"title":"Single word for old and many-times-seen content","body":"<p>Using <code>old</code> as a starting word, Urban Dictionary suggested:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Obsolete</li>\n<li>Outdated</li>\n<li>Archaic</li>\n<li>Ancient</li>\n<li>Retro</li>\n<li>Passe  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And I have to say that <strong>none</strong> of them really fit. The first two can describe software, but you don't <em>update</em> your old memes, they just get old and you rarely re-see them in a fit of nostalgia, deep inside your archives. #3 and #4 can be used in phrase describing how old is this post (e.g. <code>ancient as mammoth's $#!@</code>). But hey, that's a phrase, not a single word! #5 is about the style, not the freshness. #6 is completely about fashion (e.g. <code>MySpace is so passe</code>).<br>\nA friend of mine suggested <code>retoast</code>, but I'm unsure because I haven't really seen the usage.<br>\nYour suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>Update: Very sorry to break the rules, adding an example usage now.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oh no, grandpa saw a pack of my business cards, and added me to his <em>hilarious</em> e-mailing list, consisting of <strong>?????</strong> from 2007.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, if any of you guys surf russian internets, you may be familiar with <code>баян</code>. I need precisely that translated. It is a common (first) comment to many posts in social networks, as re-posting happens quite often</p>\n\n<p>Update 2: The small thing that I forgot to mention is that it's a noun in russian, I will sure accept the fact that there are no such, but it would be much more familiar to talk of <em>information units</em>, calling them <strong>?????</strong> than saying that they are <code>bromidic</code>, for example. I find <code>bromidic</code> kinda 30% suitable, but I guess I can't derive a <code>bromid</code> noun? So the speech contruction becomes longer, which is undesirable</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":252952,"title":"What is a word that means single-time optimism?","body":"<p>Hoping for something catchy, not a mundane word.
