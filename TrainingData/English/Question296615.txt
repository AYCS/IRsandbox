As a result, it is often hard, if not impossible, to be sure who exactly did what, purely on the basis of an IP address.</p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, IP addresses are very often <strong>personally identifiable</strong>, and so, following a basic precautionary principle, must be treated as such unless they can definitively proven not to be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First paragraph says that it's not easy (\"often hard, if not impossible\") to identify the exact person who did something behind a router shared with others. But \"personally identifiable\" in the second paragraph seem to say the opposite.
