I think that 2. reads better than 1., since the description of nonlinear effects is so long and the distance between 'nonlinear effects' and the verb 'examined' is quite long as a result.

Because the published time of this article is 2000, we don't know anything about free trade after 2000 until now.

But actually we don't know about it.
