I would have said, prior to examining a few dictionaries, that evident did not necessarily mean <em>readily apparent</em>, but to my surprise it does.</p>\n\n<p>This brings me to ask what word or expression would mean something can be taken as a true fact, but not through an <strong>easily constructed (not obvious or readily apparent)</strong> rationale? </p>\n\n<p>For example, if Sherlock Holmes says something is true while everyone else is still sitting on their hands, then it is evident to Holmes, but not to the rest of the world. So, from everyone else's point of view, it is not readily apparent, and (by definition) apparently it is not <em>evident</em>, <em>clear</em>, or <em>clearly evident</em> at all, based on the dictionary definitions. But (let's stipulate) it is true and deducible from the observable evidence. What would we call this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>An update is highlighted above. I can see from some of the answers and comments that I may have gone off my mark with the phrase \"not through an easy-to-follow rationale”, and I have modified the question to correct this. I understand that there can be rationales, arguments, or proofs that, once explained, may or may not be easy to follow. What I intend is that the rationale to support the indisputable conclusion is not (initially) easy to recognize or construct (not readily apparent) in the first place. I apologize for the confusion.

That word has not yet been suggested (or approached) by any answer or comment (active or deleted) at the time of this edit. This request is changed to a single word request. (However, if you feel a single word fits well but not without some additional supporting words, please offer your thoughts in an answer.)
