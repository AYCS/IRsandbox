Is it a trendy expression?","body":"<p>I came across the word, “*make a dream board” in the sentence of New York Time’s (December 16) article titled “Split by Race and Wealth, but Discovering Similarities as They Study Steinbeck.” The article deals with the recent program of intermediate schools in two different town of Westfield and Plainfield to let their student read John Steinbeck’s “Of Mice and Men.” </p>\n\n<p>“Students in Westfield, about 25 miles southwest of Manhattan, said the project had brought a different world right to their doorstep and taught more empathy. As part of the exchange, each student <em>made a “dream board” of goals and aspirations</em> to be shared with the group on Tuesday.” </p>\n\n<p>I searched for meaning of “dream board” on Google, only to find the following description in WikiHow other than the title of internet game.</p>\n\n<p>“Setting goals is something we're all familiar with. In fact, it’s almost become a cliché that some people no longer pay attention to. Making a dream board can take the cliché out of setting your life goals, and can even help you to accomplish those goals.” </p>\n\n<p>It appears to me “make a dream board” means to “draw a blue print” in our old expression. Did it come from “Dreamboard Game”? Is it a novel expression, because the NY Times writer uses this phrase in parenthesis?</p>\n"},{"id":45097,"title":"What is the difference of “Has it right” from other affirmative expressions such as “It is right,” “It holds, “and “It makes sense”?","body":"<p>When I posted a question about usefulness or “unuseful-ness” of using Latin phrase in conversation and writing yesterday, I got an answer saying “If you did not know the meaning of a specific (Latin) phrase, it may be likely that many other people do not recognize that phrase, so it’s best to avoid it,” from someone, followed by the other user’s comment, “<em>This answer has it right</em>.”</p>\n\n<p>As I’m not familiar with the expression, “<em>Someone (or something) has it right</em>,” I checked the usage of the phrase on Google, and found the following example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The tea party <em>movement has it right</em>: Don't spend more than you have. - newsmax.com.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Obama has it right</em> in deficit plan.
