This usage is in Partridge's <em>Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</em>, 2005 edition, but not in the 1984 edition, nor is it in the 1990 edition of Partridge's <em>A dictionary of RAF slang</em>. In the 2005 dictionary, the RAF usage is dated to 2002, with the note \"Adopted from the sense 'a member of the FBI'\".

The point is that the urban \"fed\" is used for any policeman, whereas the RAF \"fed\" is only for members of the specific force: it's not used within the RAF for police in general. </p>\n\n<p>My second question - whether there are other (probably ironic) slang uses of \"fed\" for non-federal police or officials - is still open.</p>\n"},{"id":117347,"title":"Can “Any Other Business” be generally perceived, and used as the legit business terms?","body":"<p>I was interested in the fact that the first letter of the each word of “Any Other Business” is shown in the upper case in the following sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“At the first meeting of the new bard, Townsend proposed that Sir\n  Walter (Age 66) should remain as chairman on his present salary of\n  ￡100,000 a year.
