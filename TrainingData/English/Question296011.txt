My understanding of these words is that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A pedophile is sexually attracted to children.</p>\n  \n  <p>A pederast has sex with children.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, one can be a pedophile without having sex with children, and as a matter of fact, once a pedophile has sex with a child, then that person is a pederast.</p>\n\n<p>However, given the reaction to my statement, I feel I may have a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of the word <em>pedophile</em>.  Does this word imply more than just attraction?  I thought <em>-phile</em> indicated an affinity for something, not necessarily an indulgence in it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are some great answers here.  I was inspired to look deeper and found that in the English language, there are only four words ending in -erast.  These are <em>pederast, paederast</em> (alternate spelling), <em>philerast</em> (the boy in a pederastic relationship), and <em>federast</em> (merging \"federalist\" and \"pederast\").
