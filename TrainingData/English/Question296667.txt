I know grammatically both sentences must be correct but I just can't understand the usage of 'would' here.</p>\n\n<p>I have looked up some information online. They helped a lot. For example, people say'would' can be used to express your desire or hope. However, from my memory of middle school, it is 'will' that could be used to express your willingness to do something. </p>\n\n<p>According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, both words can be used to express a desire or wish.
