Another way of thinking about <em>not actual</em> as an adverbial phrase might be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"potential (and by that I mean not actual) harm\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I'm not really sure, especially since <em>not actual</em> certainly makes sense as an adjective modifying <em>harm</em>, which seems simpler. If a phrase could be seen as modifying an adjective or a noun, maybe for simplicity it should just be seen as modifying the noun?</p>\n\n<p>I guess my possibly crazy-sounding hypothesis is that it's in the middle on some kind of spectrum between adjective and adverb and we should do some kind of primary purpose test to determine which one it is for comma placement? (I can picture English teachers everywhere cringing at that suggestion...) I think this is basically what I was thinking above when I suggested it might be an adverbial phrase. (The mental picture of cringing English teachers everywhere is why I think that suggestion might be wrong.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this could be avoided altogether by just saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"potential harm, not actual harm\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But that's no fun. :)</p>\n\n<p>So what do you think?

There are a lotSo much so that now it all looks like a jumble of which adjectives sound better with ‘and’ in between or sound good in reverse order. In fact, reversing the order of adjectives don't help my brain at all, like the following example from <em>New Hart’s Rules</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>thin, long piece of wood</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, ‘long, thin piece of wood’ feels unnatural to me, yet a comma is required since ‘thin and long piece’ sounds good. Of course, reversing the order and using ‘and’ are just <em>tests</em> for helping you decide—the real reasons need lengthier explanations.</p>\n\n<p>And that is the reason for this post—the difference in explanation of <em>New Hart’s Rules</em>, <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> and the rest of the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>The various articles on the Internet give the same information as <em>CMOS</em>—<strong>coordinate adjectives</strong> need a comma between them, as they are modifying the following noun independently, and <strong>cumulative adjectives</strong> don't need a comma.</p>\n\n<p>But <em>NHR</em> gives a completely different set of rules and terms, though mostly arriving at the same conclusion of when to use a comma:</p>\n\n<p>Coordinate and cumulative adjectives are not mentioned at all. What we have are <strong>gradable</strong> or <strong>qualitative adjectives</strong> and <strong>classifying adjectives</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Two gradable/qualitative adj. need comma in between. Two classifying adj. or one classifying with gradable/qualitative adj. don’t need a comma. It also mentions a test: use of ‘very’ is possible with gradable and qualitative adjectives as they have comparative and superlative forms. This test doesn't work with classifying adjectives.</p>\n\n<p>So, please share your thoughts on why Oxford doesn’t explain adjective-comma issue the way <em>CMOS</em> does. Are they talking about exactly the same kind of adjectives with the same logic, or is it just coincidence that they end up with similar decisions? What are your personal gripes and solutions in deciding for a comma between more complex and unusual adjectives?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> E.g. <em>horny, toothless beak</em>: It feels normal to say ‘horny and toothless beak’, but by the rules of <em>NHR</em>, ‘toothless’ is a classifying adjective, hence a comma is not required.
