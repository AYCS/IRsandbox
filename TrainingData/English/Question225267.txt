[{"id":225267,"title":"How and when did &quot;bash&quot; and &quot;do&quot; come to mean party?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>I am on my way to a faculty <strong>party</strong> at the university.

The author Louise Doughty includes two synonyms for party; a <em>bash</em> and a <em>do</em>. <em><a href=\"http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/bash_2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bash</a></em> is slang, it conjures a wild type of party, possibly impromptu, raucous and loud. </p>\n\n<p>Etymonline says <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bash\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>On a bash \"on a drunken spree\" is slang from 1901, which gave the word its sense of \"party.\"</em></a> Does that mean the first time \"bash\" was used to mean <em>party</em> is in 1901? I understand that the expression <em>on a bash</em> is from 1901, so <em>bash</em> must have come later.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/do_1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>do</strong></a> on the other hand, sounds as if the party is quite formal, where one is expected to dress up and behave in a socially acceptable manner. Dos are, typically, weddings, landmark birthdays or grand social events. In this case a faculty party can be called a <em>do</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>mainly UK informal a party or other social event:<br>\n  <em>Colin's having a bit of a do for his 50th birthday.</em><br>\n  <em>It was one of those dos where nobody really knew each other.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are the distinctions I made between between <em>bash</em> and <em>do</em> correct?</li>\n<li>How (and when) did \"bash\" and \"do\" mean party?</li>\n</ul>\n","related_questions":[{"id":142492,"title":"Where did the word “quim” come from?","body":"<p>Both the OED and Etymonline offer no clue as to origin of the slang term <em>quim</em>, meaning <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/142493/where-does-the-word-minge-come-from\"><em>minge</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>The OED’s earliest citations are from the 18<sup>th</sup>, which isn’t quite as old as Adam, but has certainly been around for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Here are two of its later citations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1966 P.

And so I turn to you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-Update-</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've not managed to find any further links between flogging and selling, which has led me to consider this possibility: Is it possible that the two meanings are unrelated? I had made the assumption that the \"selling\" variant was somehow derived from the same word which means \"to whip or beat\", but perhaps it's not. </p>\n\n<p>Judging by the demographic from which the word appears to come from (first referenced by authors from around London), and given that its original meaning implied the illicit sale of goods, perhaps \"to flog something\" (in the sense of selling it) is a form of contrived rhyming slang. </p>\n\n<p>Could anyone back this up?</p>\n"},{"id":143830,"title":"How did &quot;ropey&quot; come to mean &quot;of poor quality&quot;?","body":"<p>Rope is typically long, strong and fibrous.</p>\n\n<p>So how did us Brits come to use \"ropey\" to describe <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ropy?q=ropey\">something of poor quality</a>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>British informal</em> of poor quality:<br/>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>a portrait by a pretty ropey artist</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While we're on the subject, why do we also say we \"feel ropey\" when we're not too well or hungover?</p>\n"},{"id":157818,"title":"How did the words &quot;petting&quot; and &quot;necking&quot; come to mean kissing with passion?","body":"<p>I'm sure most of you have heard \"necking\" to mean kissing with passion; however, before \"necking\" the popular word among American youth was \"petting\". <em>From Flappers to Rappers: The Study of American Youth Slang</em> by Dr. Thomas Dalzell states that by the middle of the 1920s folks overwhelmingly were using the word necking instead of petting.

Judging by the comments, dictionary articles are absolutely exhaustive, and it just must be obvious to everyone how <em>'to take the side of'</em> transformed to <em>'have a good time'</em> without any explanation.
