The interaction between each of these elements and principles are all described by a single words, such as for example: 'strengthens' and 'conquers' and 'absorbs'. All these interactions are single words (a fact that is also embedded into the backstory) one of these interactions could best be described as 'decays into', but since this is not a single word, it has to be either reworded by a synonym (the preferred option) or replaced by something else.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this clarifies the question enough.</p>\n"},{"id":238248,"title":"An adjective or a single word that means something is &quot;new&quot; and &quot;different&quot; at the same time","body":"<p>When we say this approach is \"New,\" new, here, doesn't necessarily imply that the approach is different from preceding approaches.</p>\n\n<p>When we say that it is \"different,\" different, here, doesn't imply that it is new.</p>\n\n<p>So is there an adjective or a word that could denote both meanings?</p>\n\n<p>Here is the context:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>to unravel .......... reasons and motivations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":237845,"title":"Is there a single word for &quot;Things to do&quot; in different languages?","body":"<p>I'm looking for a single word or a phrase that means \"Things to do / tasks\".
