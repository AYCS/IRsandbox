Ther rease, upon sum accident, quhither quho, quhen, quhat, etc., sould be symbolized with q or w, a hoat disputation betuene him and me.  After manie conflictes (for we ofte encountered), we met be chance, in the citie of Baeth, with a Doctour of divinitie of both our acquentance.  He invited us to denner.  At table my antagonist, to bring the question on foot amangs his awn condisciples, began that I was becum an heretik, and the doctour spering how, ansuered that I denyed quho to be spelled with a w, but with qu.  Be quhat reason? quod the Doctour.  Here, I beginning to lay my grundes of labial, dental, and guttural [<em>velar?</em>] soundes and symboles, he snapped me on this hand and he on that, that the doctour had mikle a doe to win me room for a syllogisme.  Then (said I) a labial letter can not symboliz a guttural syllab.  But w is a labial letter, quho a guttural sound.  And therfoer w can not symboliz quho, nor noe syllab of that nature.  Here the doctour staying them again (for al barked at ones), the proposition, said he, I understand; the assumption is Scottish, and the conclusion false.  Quherat al laughed, as if I had bene dryven from al replye, and I fretted to see a frivolouse jest goe for a solid ansuer.

The first part will be about the interpretation of the above, and the second part will be about the spellings in general.</p>\n\n<h2>Part 1.</h2>\n\n<p>I understand that the text is about a discussion between the author on one side and two other people (his friend and the Doctour of divinitie) on the other side. The discussion was about the spelling of the words which have “wh” in them in standard Present-day English. The author said that these words should be spelled with “quh” instead of “wh”. The friend and the Doctour disagreed. The author said that the reason for his conviction that the “quh” spellings are right is that the sound in these word is guttural, which I understand means velar, and not labial.</p>\n\n<p>What was the sound the author used in this word? Was it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labialized_velar_consonant\">[ʍ]</a>? He said the sound was velar, and clearly said it wasn’t labial. Could it mean that he produced a sound that wasn’t labialized? I have never heard of such a realization of this phoneme in any historical dialect of English, but I know very little about these things and it's perfectly possible that it existed from my point of view.</p>\n\n<p>The author seems to have been Scottish. First, he advocates the spellings I have only encountered in Scottish texts, and second, according to the Doctour, he made a “Scottish assumption” about the sound. I think it could mean that the Doctour was English (did he live in Bath?) and used the delabialized allophone. I don’t know when the split occurred, or when the text was written, so I can’t judge whether it’s possible. </p>\n\n<p>He says, “As for quho, besydes that it differres from quo onelie be aspiration, and that w, being noe perfect consonant, can not be aspirated, I appele to al judiciouse eares, to quhilk Cicero attributed mikle, quhither the aspiration in quho be not ex imo gutture, and therfoer not labial.”</p>\n\n<p>I understand the “quo” he’s talking about is the Latin word. I think that this might be a clue that the spellings were a Latin influence, which I thought anyway when I first encountered one. But his explanation of the phonetics is puzzling to me. He says that “quho” and “quo” differ only in aspiration. I will not try to give my guesses about that here because it would make this post even longer than it is. I’ll just ask what he could have meant by that. I know of course that he surely knew less about phonetics than we do now and that he didn’t have our standardized terminology, but he must have meant something, mustn't he? And again, how did he pronounce “quho”?</p>\n\n<h2>Part 2.</h2>\n\n<p>So what were those spellings about? What were their origins? When did they die out? Were they only used in Scotland or in England as well? Why?</p>\n\n<p>Here's another, seemingly related spelling: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>WHEEN</strong>, <em>n</em>.2 I.Sc. form of Eng. <em>queen</em> (Sh. 1825 Jam.; I.Sc. 1866 Edm. <em>Gl</em>.; Sh. 1916 J. Burgess <em>Rasmie’s Smaa Murr</em> (Maerch 20); I.Sc. 1974). See P.L.D. § 165 and <strong>W</strong>, letter, 7. (2) (ii). [ʍin] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This confuses me even more. Was it some kind of hypercorrectness introduced by those who, like the Doctour, didn’t like the spellings with the “q”? It seems rather inconsistent though, as it is not “quheen”, but “queen”.</p>\n"},{"id":229346,"title":"What is the origin of &quot;rat&quot;?","body":"<p>A simple little word for a common little fella. Yet, the origin is unknown (<em>or not?</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Both <em>OED</em> and <em>Etymonline</em> are bold enough to say \"of uncertain origin\"; but, of course, they try to explain the etymology of <em>rat</em> with <em>Latin, Romanic, Germanic, Celtic and Greek</em> connections.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cat&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\"><em>Etymonline</em></a> summarizes in the first paragraph as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>late Old English <em>ræt</em> \"rat,\" of uncertain origin.

L. Armitage in Antiquity 68 (1994) 231–40).</li>\n  <li>A derivation &lt; an ablaut variant of the Indo-European base of classical Latin <em>rōdere</em> to gnaw (see rodent adj.) has been suggested, but seems unlikely in the light of the apparently recent introduction of the word.</li>\n  <li>A suggested derivation of the Romance words &lt; classical Latin <em>rapidus</em> rapid adj. is no longer accepted, as it would only account for the Italian, which for chronological and historical reasons cannot be the single origin of the whole group.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, I didn't stop ratting there and checked historical records that include the word \"rat\" and found the oldest etymological and lexical references as follows:</p>\n\n<p>From \"An universal etymological English dictionary\" <em>By Nathan Bailey</em> (1731):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BVczQ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"> <br>\n<sub>[<em>(obsolete)</em> Teut. -> Teutonic -> Germanic]</sub></p>\n\n<p>From \"A dictionary of the English language : in which the words are deduced from their originals, and illustrated in their different significations by examples from the best writers : to which are prefixed, a history of the language, and an English grammar\"\n <em>By Samuel Johnson</em> (1766):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eFqOY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>And the rat-hunting went on an' on and I ended up with the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat\">brown rat</a></em> (and its etymological origin) which is one of the best known and most common rat. It is named <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> (Norwegian rat) which is a misnomer because the English naturalist John Berkenhout gave the binomial name, believing it had migrated to England from Norwegian ships in 1728 (which is disproven later.)</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of 19th century, the etymology of <em>brown rat</em> was better understood and the following note is mentioned in \"Natural History\" <em>by American scholar Alfred Henry Miles</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The brown rat is the species common in England, and best known throughout the world. <strong>It is said to have travelled from Persia to England less than two hundred years ago</strong> and to have spread from thence to other countries visited by English ships</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This finding gives a hint that the origin of the word <em>rat</em> might be of <em>Persian</em> origin (and also <em>Sanskrit</em>)<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rat\"> [Wiktionary</a> puts as \"Middle Persian <em>randītan</em> (“to scrape, smooth”), Sanskrit <em>rádati</em> (“he gnaws, cuts”)).\"] </p>\n\n<p>Also mentioned in \"The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World\" <em>By J.
