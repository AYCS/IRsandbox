Probably from <em>cohort</em>, Spanish and French, defined in the old French and English Dictionary of Hollyband, 1593, as \"a company, a band.\" It is used at the South and West [of the United States] to denote a company or union of men for a predatory excursion, and sometimes for a partnership in business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A Google Books search reveals that John Jamieson, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=eItTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA115&amp;dq=%22cahute%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6vdH3vp7JAhWCmYgKHb4fAU4Q6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cahute%22&amp;f=false\"><em>An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</em></a> (1808) lists <em>cahute</em> as a Scottish word (drawn from French) with two meanings:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CAHUTE, s. 1. The cabin of a ship. [Example:] Into the Katherine thou made a foul cahute. <em>Evergreen</em>, ii. 71. at 26. Katherine is the name of the ship here referred to. This is probably the primary sense. 2. A small or private apartment of any kind. [Example omitted.]</p>\n  \n  <p>Germ. <em>kaiute</em>, <em>koiute</em>, the cabin of a ship, Su.G. <em>kaijuta</em>, id. Wachter derives the term from <em>koie</em>, a place inclosed; Belg. <em>schaaps-kooi</em>, a fold for sheep. C. B. <em>cau</em>, to shut; Gr κωοι, caverna. He also mentions Gr. κεω cubo, and κοιτη cubile, as probablre roots of <em>koie</em> and <em>koiute</em>. Fr. <em>cahute</em>, a hut, a cottage; Ir. <em>ca</em>, <em>cai</em>, a house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would strengthens Merriam-Webster's theory that <em>cahoot</em> originated with the French <em>cahute</em>, since Scottish immigrants to the United States might have brought Scottish <em>cahute</em> with them.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the 1829 instance of cahoot cited by Merriam-Webster is probably the following one (cited in J.E. Lighter, <em>Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang</em> [1993] as being from 1829), from Samuel Kirkham, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=4E9gAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22cahoot%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIsca3ip7JAhVQO4gKHaYnB1k4HhDoAQgqMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cahoot%22&amp;f=false\"><em>English Grammar in Familiar Lectures</em></a> (1831), in a chapter on \"Provincialisms\" and a subsection on instances from Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, or Mississippi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hese in cahoot with me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which is corrected by Kirkham to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>He is</em> in <em>partnership</em> with me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ExQYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22cohoot%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmn5edvJ7JAhUGOIgKHd-_Cos4ChDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cohoot%22&amp;f=false\">1833 edition of Kirkham</a> has <em>cohoot</em> for <em>cahoot</em>, and J.L. Lighter indicates that the 1829 edition did as well, which suggests that the word may first have appeared in U.S. English with the spelling <em>cohoot</em>—which certainly more in common with <em>cohort</em> than with <em>cahute</em>. For its part, Lighter approaches the etymology question with caution:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>cahoot</strong> <em>n</em> {orig. uncert.; perh.
