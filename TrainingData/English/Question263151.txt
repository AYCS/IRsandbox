Our Latin master carefully segregated the six indicative tenses into two groups: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first three were called Present, Imperfect, Future.</li>\n<li>The second three, or compound tenses were Perfect, Pluperfect and Future Perfect.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I still call the English tenses by those names. However in English there is a simple past tense  (I ran, he spoke) which is not the case in Latin. Similarly in French there is the Past Historic, but which is only used in formal writing. </p>\n\n<p>So as far as I'm concerned the English tenses are 'present, past, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Present -       I help, I run, I have  or I am helping, I am running, I am having.</p>\n\n<p>Past -        I helped, I ran, I had</p>\n\n<p>Imperfect -   I was helping, I was running, I was having</p>\n\n<p>Future  -     I will help, I will run, I will have or I shall help etc</p>\n\n<p>Perfect  -    I have helped, I have run, I have had  (Past par'ciple) helped, run, had</p>\n\n<p>Pluperfect-   I had helped, I had run, I had had. (e,g I had had my breakfast by the time he arrived.</p>\n\n<p>Future Perfect - I shall have helped, I shall have run, I shall have had (e.g. I shall have run ten miles before she starts)     </p>\n\n<p>But I note that my children, as well as many here refer to the present perfect, and the past perfect. Presumably these are what I would have called the perfect and the pluperfect respectively. Is that right?  </p>\n"}]}]
