[{"id":296222,"title":"Silent &quot;e&quot; at the end of words","body":"<p>Back in 2009, a job interviewer sent me a link to a web service that would help me make a free telephone call via the internet... Skype.  As a native speaker, I knew \"instinctively\" to pronounce this \"sky p,\" not \"sky pee.\"</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to now and it is very common in my classroom to hear students pronounce this \"Sky pee.\"  Same with \"you tu bee\" (<em>YouTube</em>). My usual answer to why the ‘e’ is not pronounced is not satisfying to me, maybe students accept it because \"English makes no sense,\" but I cannot accept that.</p>\n\n<p>Just a quick look through <em>The First Folio</em> shows that many English words used to have an ‘e’ at the end, words that now don't.  I cannot say whether those words were pronounced differently because of the ‘e’.  My guess, based on the little I know about original pronunciation, is that they weren't pronounced differently, in the sense of \"ee\" sound added to the end, as in \"tree.\"</p>\n\n<p>If I had to guess about the ‘e’ I would say that some of the words picked up the ‘e’ because they have a German root in which the ‘e’ is pronounced.  However, I have seen \"tell\" spelled \"telle\" and \"show\" spelled \"showe.\"</p>\n\n<p>Various answers I have come across: 1. Printers were paid extra for extra letters so they added ‘e’ to get paid more. 2. That's English, so get over it. 3. No one knows, same as no one really knows who shot JFK and if they say they know they're liars. 4. The old days of English spelling were the \"Wild West\" and anything went until Sheriff Webster brought law and order to the untamed frontier, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Silent ‘e’ is such a big thing that most native speakers are familiar with the term and learn it in school or on <em>Sesame Street</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why was ‘e’ added to the end of so many words, if it wasn't going to be pronounced?</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  I understand that ‘e’ changes the pronunciation and that English has many exceptions and variations.  But, at one time it wasn't haphazard; \"show\" and \"old\" were written with an ‘e’.  Why if it wasn't pronounced?  <em>Old</em> is pronounced \"old.\"  The ‘e’ isn't necessary to change the vowels.  How else would it be pronounced?  What about \"have\"? Was the ‘e’ swept along with all of \"Olde Englishe\" other spellings?</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few words that used to have ‘e’ at the end: <em>learne</em>, <em>stuffe</em>, <em>sadnesse</em>, <em>mee</em>, <em>selfe</em>, <em>minde</em>, <em>flye</em>, <em>grasse</em>, <em>harme</em>, <em>winde</em>, <em>quicke</em>, <em>alwayes</em>, <em>worke</em>, <em>lordshippe</em>, <em>booke</em> (but <em>foot</em> often did not have the ‘e’ added) etc., etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong>: I am not interested in an answer or comment that points me to a website containing rules and observations about silent ‘e’.  I don't want an answer that tells me that silent ‘e’ changes <em>can</em> into <em>cane</em>; a long sound, I already know that.  Ermanam's answer is a step in the right direction, however there are so many words that used to have an ‘e’ tacked on to the end and don't seem to follow any reasoning that I can see.  Why an ‘e’ and not an ‘i’ or some symbol that wasn't a letter?  What about the word \"<em>sadnesse</em>\"?  What's the ‘e’ there for?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":20941,"title":"Why is the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;cocoa&quot; silent?","body":"<p>Not being a native speaker of English, one of those words that tripped me up is “cocoa”.
