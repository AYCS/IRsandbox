New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“My father was proud once when I won a horse show in boarding school. And he was proud when I was brave when I broke my arm. And man, I’ve <em>hauled those out</em> innumerable times.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I’m not familiar with the expression, “haul something out,” I looked for the definition without success in OED and CED.</p>\n\n<p>There was an entry of “hauling out” as a noun in Wikipedia, defining it as; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Hauling-out is the behaviour associated with pinnipeds of temporarily leaving the water between periods of foraging activity for sites on land or ice. Hauling-out is necessary in seals for mating and giving birth and non-reproductive aggregations, termed \"haul-outs\". </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I also found the following answer to the similar question on “haul out” in www.englishforums.com/: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>(haul out is) to take a heavy-handed approach to justice.

I guess it comes from the slightly stereotyped image of the sheriff going into the saloon bar and \"hauling out\" ...</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I think neither applies to Mike Nichols’ statement, “I’ve hauled those out innumerable times.”\nWhat does “<em>haul something out</em>” mean?
