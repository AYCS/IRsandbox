For example, I don't think it fits into \"adverbially, the subject being understood to be the same as that of the main clause\" since \"he\" is the object of \"making\" and the subject seems to be something else, and it doesn't seem to fit \"similarly, but with a different subject, placed before the participle\" since there is no subject in \"making him the tallest person in the room.\" </p>\n"},{"id":287149,"title":"How does &quot;ain&#39;t&quot; work?","body":"<p>From what I know, \"ain't\" works as a negation is any tense or form.
