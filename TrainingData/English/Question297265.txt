[{"id":297265,"title":"&quot;I shoulda &#39;STOOD&#39; IN BED?&quot;","body":"<p>I've heard folks use \"stood\" as a kind of past-participle of the verb \"stay\" - as in: \"I shoulda stood in bed\". I had always thought it was some kind of uneducated regionalism... But, it's New Years, (Happy and Healthy, y'all) and I'm watching the 'Twilight Zone' marathon on TV, and Rod Serling just used it... \nRod Serling!\nSo, my question is... Is there a reference here? Was it an expression coined at one time (like,\"A little dab'll do ya\") in advertising or another medium? Or, is it a literary reference..? Does anyone know?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":277438,"title":"Bed and Cot : Difference and usage","body":"<p>I had a notion that cot is the wooden (Steel) frame where the bed lies. </p>\n\n<p>But recenlty I came to know it isn't.
