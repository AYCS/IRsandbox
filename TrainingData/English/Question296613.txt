I can draw simple enough trees such as \"The girl with long hair is looking at you\" and longer sentences with complements (At least I think I can draw them properly). Since I just started exploring grammar trees a few days ago there are a lot of things which I don´t know how to draw. For example \" Living in China for so many years made me miss home\" How would I draw the clause \"Living in china? Another problem is the relative clause. How does one draw that? A complement clause you would mark with CP, but I am at a loss when it comes to other clauses. I know that this might seem like silly questions but I would love to be able to draw  parse trees properly.
