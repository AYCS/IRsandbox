I have doubts how should I use question marks and exclamation marks in conjunction with quotation marks.</p>\n\n<p>I have written 5 separate sentences to illustrate this issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>He asked, \"Why should I do this?\"</li>\n  <li>\"Where are we going?\"</li>\n  <li>\"Let's get out of here!\"</li>\n  <li>He yelled, \"I want you to do this now!\"</li>\n  <li>\"I don't want to do this!\" I screamed back</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my opinion, all question and exclamation marks should be placed inside quotation marks, because I am quoting words of the character, which include question or exclamation mark. If I put question/exclamation mark after closing quotation mark, it feels weird. So I think that all sentences written above are correct as far as punctuation goes.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have a friend who says this is wrong way. He says that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I should put question mark <strong>outside</strong> of quotation mark (<strong>\"?</strong>) if the whole sentence is a question</li>\n<li>I should put question mark <strong>inside</strong> of quotation mark (<strong>?\"</strong>) if the question is only part of the sentence</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So with my friend's rules, those sentences would read as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>He asked, \"Why should I do this?\"</li>\n  <li>\"Where are we going\"?</li>\n  <li>\"Let's get out of here\"!</li>\n  <li>He yelled, \"I want you to do this now!\"</li>\n  <li>\"I don't want to do this!\" I screamed back</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems wrong for me. This friend mentioned that this is correct way according to MLA style. He referenced MLA 3.2.11. as specific example. (I think he meant guideline number. When I searched for it online, I came to <a href=\"http://usc.ac.ir/IPPWebV1C035/TemplateFileFolder/11-20-2012/OriginalFolder/14920c09-d3d0-401e-a88f-3480925f9aa6_Handbook_for_Writers7th_Edition.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this document</a> which has following guideline heading: \"3.2.11. Periods, Question Marks, and Exclamation Points\".) However, I see 2 issues with that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>As far as I know MLA guidelines only concern writing research papers, not fiction works like novels</li>\n<li>Examples in 3.2.11. do not suggest, in my opinion, that his way of writing those sentences is correct, even if I wanted to apply MLA style to my novel</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So my question is: which way of writing those sentences is correct way? If none is correct, what is correct way? And <strong>is there any credible source that confirms one of those versions is correct?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Side question: Should MLA style be used for works of fiction or only research/scientific papers?</p>\n"},{"id":138030,"title":"Confusion about characters in a dialogue: I can&#39;t fathom who spoke what from the punctuation","body":"<p>I am reading The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Conner (The Noonday Press). In the second story, there's a conversation going on between Rayber and the barber.

My understanding of English language's punctuation was that when a dialogue between two characters is written, the paragraph is only changed when the turn of the first character finishes, and the turn of the second character begins. In cases where there is paragraphing within the quote of the first character, the double quotes do not close at the end of the first paragraph, but do start at the beginning of the next one, signifying that the text is still in the quotation of the first character.
