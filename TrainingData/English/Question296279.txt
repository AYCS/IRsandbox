Why?","body":"<p>Inspired by comments on <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/12542/proper-use-of-the-word-lousy\"><em>Proper use of the word “lousy”?</em></a>:</p>\n\n<p>The word <em>lousy</em> is traditionally pronounced with a /z/ sound, as though it were <em>louzy</em>.<sup>*</sup>  Contrastingly, the word <em>mousy</em> is always pronounced with an /s/ sound.  The difference seems to be pretty consistent and well-established: these are the only pronunciations listed in the OED and Merriam-Webster for each.</p>\n\n<p>But their root words, <em>louse</em> and <em>mouse</em>, are pronounced identically, both with /s/.  Indeed, these words are parallel in almost every other way: they form analogous plurals — <em>lice</em>, <em>mice</em> — and have very similar origins.</p>\n\n<p>So how and why did the pronunciations of <em>lousy</em> and <em>mousy</em> diverge?  And are there any other analogous words that also form analogous adjectives?  (<em>House</em> doesn’t form <em>*housy</em>; and <em>blousy</em> exists, but <em>blouse</em> is not analogous to the other words.)</p>\n\n<p>*: <sub>It seems that recently, since the literal meaning “infested with lice” has become rare, it may sometimes get pronounced with /s/ in this sense, as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation\">spelling pronunciation</a>.</sub></p>\n"},{"id":244356,"title":"Why are &quot;suffice&quot; and &quot;sufficient&quot; pronounced so differently?","body":"<p>Today I heard somebody use a form of the verb \"<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suffice\" rel=\"nofollow\">suffice</a>\" (which means \"to be sufficient\") pronouncing it like the verb \"surface\" without an r (and where that \"a\" makes more of an \"i\" sound).
