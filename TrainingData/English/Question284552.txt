One of the most common mistakes I find is the use of the noun <em>evidences</em>. Now, the dictionary definitions I have read state that <em>evidence</em> is a mass noun, that it is not countable. For example, <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evidence\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>noun [mass noun]<br></p>\n  \n  <p>the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid:the study finds little evidence of overt discrimination <br></p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Law information drawn from personal testimony, a document, or a material object, used to establish facts in a legal investigation or\n  admissible as testimony in a law court:without evidence, they can’t\n  bring a charge<br></li>\n  <li>signs or indications of something:there was no obvious evidence of a break-in</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I came across (don't ask me how) this article: <a href=\"http://creation.com/age-of-the-earth\" rel=\"nofollow\">101 evidences for a young age of the earth and the universe</a></p>\n\n<p>I had firstly assumed that this was either an outright error or at best a usage that is specific to christian literature, but upon further analysis things get more complicated. On the one hand, most <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;evidences&quot;\" rel=\"nofollow\">google hits</a> for <em>evidences</em> seem to be from the christian fundamentalist and/or creationist literature, on the other hand <a href=\"http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/evidences.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> has collected multiple examples of its use citing such luminaries of the English language as William Shakespeare, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Indeed, this <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=many%20evidences&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=\" rel=\"nofollow\">google NGram</a> shows that <em>evidences</em> used to be quite common (note that I am searching for \"<em>many</em> evidences\" which should filter out most uses of <em>evidence</em> as a transitive verb):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tWw7R.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Finally, I also found a <a href=\"http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/evidence_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">definition</a> in the online Oxford Learner's Dictionary which includes the following line:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(technical) The cave contained evidences of prehistoric settlement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While I have encountered this use in technical literature (my field is biology), it was always used by non-native authors in whose language, as is very often the case, <em>evidence</em> is probably countable (e.g. ES: <em>evidencias</em>, FR: <em>évidences</em>).</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is, is <em>evidence</em> countable? The two quoted definitions contradict themselves. <em>Evidences</em> as a plural noun sounds horrible to my native's ear. Apparently, it is indeed a valid archaic usage but is it grammatical today?  I don't have access to an unabridged OED or any other dictionary of similar status and quality, what do they suggest? </p>\n"},{"id":167914,"title":"Where in the world are cabinets called cupboards?","body":"<p>I understand the difference between <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/5415/whats-the-difference-between-cabinet-and-cupboard\">cabinet and cupboard</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have spent part of my life redoing houses and I have only ever heard of <em>kitchen cabinets</em>.
