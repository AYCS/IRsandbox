Almost everyone I hear making these constructions uses the plural form. What are your thoughts about singular vs. plural here?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here's a more extreme example that may help clarify the issue. Consider the following sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was my first attempt at calming an angry crowd, and I just \n      stood there while people were hurling all kinds of insults at me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here I think the singular <em>insult</em> sounds strange, if not downright wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Further Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p>I just noticed in <em>A Treasury for Word Lovers</em> (Morton S. Freeman, 1983) a section entitled \"Types of Errors.\" This is a book about (American) English usage by an English professor and editor, which purports to be a \"practical guide for serious writers and readers.\" I wish I could say this discovery satisfies the question, but in fact I now feel somewhat farther from the truth, if there is any single \"truth\" in this matter. But at least I don't have to worry about being wrong when using the plural form of the class in these constructions.</p>\n"},{"id":119486,"title":"Should I use a plural when describing a state?
