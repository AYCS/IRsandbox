[{"id":45836,"title":"Is there a single word to describe a combination of a projected video and a live stage performance?","body":"<p>We're developing an entertainment module for a conclave. The format agreed upon is this: an audiovisual is projected on the screen, but is punctuated by live performances on the stage. For example, a sequence of a guy driving to work in rush hour is punctuated by a dimming of lights and while the AV fades out, real actors are seen driving on stage, seated in cutouts of cars, while the music changes tempo. The lights dim again and we see footage of the guy entering his office lobby- a 'tableau' of sorts, for want of a better/appropriate word.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there a word that describes this type of live-and-screened piece? I googled, and found the Japanese word <em>Rensageki</em>  and <em>New School Cinema.</em> I don't know about the Japanese word, but <em>New School Cinema</em> is far too generic/bland for me.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a single word to describe this better than \"Tableau\", which is what I've temporarily titled the script? Ideally, I'm looking for a single word. If none exists, a short and descriptive phrase, or a combo word like 'docudrama' will also do - as long as it is succinct/definitive. </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":288732,"title":"A word/phrase to describe cooperation of scientists who lived in different times","body":"<p>Let's imagine that Scientist A works in some field but obviously they don't do everything from scratch but rather built upon past discoveries of, for example, Scientist B who lived 200 years before Scientist A was born.</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for a word or a phrase that would describe this situation.
