So that at any month he can decide to ship it, the question is just that the quality will be higher the more months he spends on it.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas the conventional workflow perhaps make one chapter of the game reasonably good, then move onto next chapter. the downside being that if he has to abandon the project the next day then he might have a game without an ending.</p>\n\n<p>The closest word I can think of is \"iterative workflow\", but the way that word is used today means something very different, usually that word emphasizes that you listen to the results of the first iteration before moving to the second iteration. Whereas what I'm trying to describe is rather emphisized on the fact that at any time the product can be shipped. each interation may or may not involve playtesting.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":279342,"title":"In what case should the subject of a gerund phrase be?","body":"<p>When given the following problem:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A) Bill took the money.\n\nB) That shows his character.\n\nTurn clause A into a nominal clause or phrase and make it the subject of b.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I came up with three grammatical possibilities:</p>\n\n<p>1) That Bill took the money shows his character. </p>\n\n<p>2) For Bill to take the money shows his character.</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>Bill's</strong> taking the money shows his character.</p>\n\n<p>None sit well with me.
