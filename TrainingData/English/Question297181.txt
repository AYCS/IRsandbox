But the problem with questioned sentence is that there is \"I\" at the beginning and \"the one...\" at the end, after \"to\". It seems like two subjects and I just don't know for who \"they\" are of no concern.</p>\n\n<p>Of course I can guess the meaning but I would really like to know something more about this structure.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":295163,"title":"What&#39;s the exact meaning of a decree?","body":"<p>At first, I thought it just meant an \"order\", yet it didn't make much sense in the context it was in.</p>\n\n<p>I was watching a historical TV show, in which a powerful man, an ally of the King (not really an ally, but more of a follower whom the King needs), was telling the King of a near attack of the enemy. He told the King to \"<strong>speak his decree, and it will be done\"</strong>. The King replied \"there's no need for decrees, nor sermons to rouse. We march, before they do\".\nThen, the ally asked the king to let <em>him</em> lead the assault, if not, he will abandon the King. The King was furious, he told him that he doesn't need him, and banished him. Then, the ally told the King that while the King marches to the enemy, he will march towards their true capital, and defend it. Then the King said: \"<strong>No one asked you to make a decree, yet you do so here before <em>my</em> throne</strong>?\"</p>\n\n<p>From my understanding, the word <em>decree</em> means, as stated by <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/official\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Oxford English Dictionary</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>1 An official order that has the force of law</em></p>\n  \n  <p><em>1.2 A judgement or decision of certain law courts, especially in matrimonial cases.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've also checked several other dictionaries, they basically give the same definitions. My problem is that none of the given definitions fits in any of the two sentences.\nLook at the first sentence, the King said \"we march\", which <em>is</em> an order (or would at least require him to make orders in order to march), but that was right after he said \"there is no need for decrees\". If so, the King must think that a <em>decree</em> is different than a simple <em>order</em>. After that, look at the second sentence, the King accused his ally of \"making a <em>decree</em>\", but the ally did not make any decrees\\orders (by my understanding). And if he did, it wasn't official, the whole conversation took place in the same place, the King's court. So, if something the ally said was a decree, then the King's statement must also be a decree; they were said in the same manner, and in the same place.</p>\n\n<p>This is the script for the scene I speak of, if anyone wants to read it themselves:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Kaidu): The Cricket Minister comes this way.\n  His troops are mobilizing.\n  War is upon us once again.\n  <strong>Speak your decree</strong>, cousin.\n  It will be done.\n  <br>(The Khan): <strong>There's no need for decrees</strong>.\n  Or sermons to rouse.\n  We march before they do.\n  Go.\n  <br>(Kaidu): By your will, Sire.\n  And by the House of ÃgÃdei, I will lead your tumens.\n  <br>(The Khan): Praises, cousin.\n  You will ride with our tumens and my sons.\n  I name you commander of 1,000 men.\n  But I lead this assault.\n  You ride with the House of Kublai.\n  <br>(Kaidu): I am grateful for the honor, Khagan.\n  But hear me, please, cousin.\n  Twice my men and horses have ridden under your banner.\n  Twice my men and two sons have fallen to the Chinese.\n  If I do not lead this next assault my men will return north, and I with them.\n  <br>(The Khan's Son): Lord Kaidu, there's no need to rush.\n  <br>(The Khan): Let him rush.\n  Let him rush home to be king of his ger village.\n  King of nomads and sheep.\n  <br>(Kaidu): You mock nomads?

But when I searched Google, I realized it is used frequently (at least according to the book section). </p>\n\n<p>\"As you said\" is a dependent clause that needs an independent clause, for \"as\" in that case is used as a subordinating conjunction. I just do not understand how that subordinating conjunction can be used WITHIN an independent clause. Also, I think that \"as you said\" is working as a predicative adjective phrase (though it is a clause) and this doesn't make any sense to me. </p>\n\n<p>Is the usage wrong, or am I wrong? And if I am, why? </p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>Well, subordinating conjunction CAN BE used in an independent clause.
