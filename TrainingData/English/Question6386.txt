And if I type \"lunatic\" in Google, it tells me that it is a  mentally ill person. Does that mean Google offends mentally ill people by telling me that's what a lunatic is? Or maybe Google has the right to use it, but not me?</p>\n\n<p>In that logic, if I call a person a \"dog\" this is obviously offensive, therefore following that logic strictly, that word should not be used, not even to address an actual dog. Does this mean black people offend each other by calling their buddies \"dog\"? And that is just an example, imagination is pretty much the only limit when counting the words which can be put in an offensive context.</p>\n\n<p>Another example, it has recently become offensive to call a retarded person retarded, the correct term is now \"special needs\", but how long before \"special needs\" becomes an insult too, which it inevitably will if it becomes the widely used term to refer to retarded people? \"Special needs\" can actually be offensive right out of the box, if used to address a non-retarded person and imply that person is retarded, and one can argue that in a way, using that word to insult a normal person is also insensitive and offensive to all \"special needs\" people in existence?</p>\n\n<p>And how come it doesn't even matter what kind of a context a word is being put in or whether offense is actually intended? Will this continue until half of the vocabulary is squeezed out of use and labeled implicitly offensive, even if explicitly stated to not be intended as such?</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, are we doing anyone a favor by labeling more and more words as \"offensive\" and therefore granting previously inoffensive words the power to offend? I mean, if it is \"inconsiderate assholes\" who turn normal words into insults, how \"smart\" is it for the rest of the people to give in to that?</p>\n"},{"id":226736,"title":"What&#39;s a less offensive substitute for &quot;rep-whores&quot;?","body":"<p>This is a frequently thrown-around term on Internet forums in general and Stack Exchange specifically.

Some cook, some clean, some heal, some destroy. Some heal scars, some heal minds, some destroy building to clear the way for new one... some destroy to incite the chaos\" <br>...<br> \"I always wanted to help people but the only skills I could make use of is that with my body so I use it to heal the hearts of men and women alike, allowing them to drown in pleasure and forget the world which puts them down.
