At least, that's my impression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, when you're reading that line, your eye/mind is more likely to skip over <em>those</em> without the word making an impression than over <em>people</em>. Skipping over it is a good thing in this case, since it's not the semantically important part of the line.</p>\n\n<p>You may not, of course, agree with me on that score, but my question is: How should I have described this?
