By leaning in, women would obtain more\n  authority. </p>\n  \n  <p>To understand the claims embedded in the “<strong>lean in</strong>” hypothesis, we\n  need to know why, when or how women decide to pursue positions of\n  authority in the workplace.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I haven’t read Sheryl Sandberg’s book, I don’t know what she means by “lean in.” </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately none of Cambridge, Oxford, and Merriam Webster Dictionary includes “lean in” as an idiom, though all of them carry “lean on sb. / stg.”</p>\n\n<p>What does “lean in” means?

It's becoming a best-seller. </p>\n\n<p>The title and the word, ‘Lean In’ of the Japanese version are translated as “Make a step forward.” However, I wonder if “Make a step forward” exactly fits what Sandberg intends to convey and what you perceive with this word. </p>\n\n<p>To me \"lean in\" and \"make a step forword\"- there's the axiom in Zen, 'Make a stepfoward at the end of a cliff to get Satori (spiritual enlightment) - sound different as a physical action or posture, setting aside the state and level of mind.</p>\n"},{"id":117279,"title":"What is the exact meaning of “You&#39;ve got yourself a deal”?
