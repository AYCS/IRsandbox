[{"id":297127,"title":"Tone: Caustic vs. Acerbic vs. Satiric","body":"<p>I'm having some trouble determining which of these three tone words would best apply to the excerpt below, taken from Richard Seaver's letter in the <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2013/07/its-real-thing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coca Cola Letters</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We note with sympathy your feeling that you have a proprietary interest in the phrase \"It's the real thing,\" and I can fully understand that the public might be confused by our use of the expression, and mistake a book by a Harlem schoolteacher for a six-pack of Coca-Cola. Accordingly, we have instructed all our salesmen to notify bookstores that whenever a customer comes in and asks for a copy of Diary of a Harlem Schoolteacher they should request the sales personnel to make sure that what the customer wants is the book, rather than a Coke. This, we think, should protect your interest and in no way harm ours.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merriam Webster's</a>, the following are the definitions for these three words:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Caustic (adj)</strong> - very harsh and critical; marked by incisive sarcasm</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Acerbic (adj)</strong> - expressing sharp or harsh criticism in a clever way</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Satire (noun)</strong> - a way of using humor to show that someone or something is foolish, weak, bad, etc. : humor that shows the weaknesses or bad qualities of a person, government, society, etc.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm thinking that the best word to describe the tone in Seaver's letter is a combination of satiric and caustic, but I feel like the \"clever way\" part of the Acerbic definition would apply here as well. Seaver's sarcasm was, indeed, cleverly articulated in a subtle yet simultaneously obvious way. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any word with a definition that combines those of all three words? If not, which of the given options is best to use in this context?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":296319,"title":"Word for making an implication with tone","body":"<p>Sometimes when people use the name of the person they're talking to in a statement it's used to dismiss the discussion at hand.

Tone is generally conveyed through the choice of words or the viewpoint of a writer on a particular subject.\"</p>\n\n<p>In preparing to present these slides to the class, I realized that I was confused about the relationship between \"style analysis,\" \"tone,\" and \"voice.\" All terms that came up in the PowerPoint (and mentioned above). Researching on the internet I found a <a href=\"http://www.umuc.edu/writingcenter/onlineguide/tutorial/chapter3/ch3-21.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Maryland</a> webpage stating that style is \"mechanical or technical aspects of writing,\" voice is the \"the unique worldview and word choices of the author,\" and tone is \"the attitude conveyed in the writing and may encompass formality, objectivity, intimacy, and similar aspects.\" But this still confuses me. Didn't the teachers slides state that tone was an author's diction (i.e. word choice)? So why is the University of Maryland including \"word choices\" in its definition of voice and not tone?   </p>\n\n<p>In an article on <a href=\"http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/understanding-voice-and-tone-in-writing?page=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quick and Dirty Tips</a>, the author briefly mentions at the bottom that tone can be seen as a subset of voice. Perhaps a relationship diagram could clear my confusion. Can anyone clearly define and explain the relationships between these three concepts? </p>\n\n<p>P.S. I'm having trouble adding \"voice\" and \"Style-Analysis\" to this post.</p>\n"},{"id":262018,"title":"Usage of &quot;reply&quot;: Please reply to me or reply me (used in formal tone)","body":"<p>Which usage is correct?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Please reply to me as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>Please reply me as soon as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In my understanding, people say, \"Please reply my mail...\" What about the ones I wrote above?
