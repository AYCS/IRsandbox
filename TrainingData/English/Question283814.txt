Yes. Has he begun the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction? Yes Are we prepared to see him terrorise his neighbours? No</em> (This is not necessarily an accurate quotation, but just an example of the sorts of things he said).</p>\n\n<p>But what interests me is this form of rhetoric which involves posing loaded questions and providing answers that make your point. Another exponent of this was Josef Stalin. In his case it has been seen by some historians as a technique he learned during his childhood education in a religious seminary. It was a form of catechism.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the rhetoric called? Is it <em>catechismic</em>?  The word does not exist (at least not in the OED) as an adjective. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>. I have briefly looked at <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/13532/answering-your-own-question/121726#121726\">the former question</a>.It is not entirely a parallel example - the OP complains that his wife does it in the course of everyday conversation. I am primarily interested in the development of an argument through this process. But the former question did bring out some interesting words - e.g. <em>sermocinatio</em>,- @Sven Yargs - which unfortunately does not have an OED entry. But I am also fascinated by the link to <em>catechism</em>, which I believe may be the provenance of this in some politicians. Someone has now come up with a suitable adjective - below.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>. I think the closest answer has been supplied by @Old English Lapdog. It seems to be the case that there are two distinct elements to this. One is that it follows the religious practice of teaching by question and supplied answer.  In that sense it relates to <em>catechism</em>. But in building an argument it is <em>rhetorical</em>. The word <em>catechetical</em> in its OED (sense 3) includes a reference to Socrates. <em>1711   J. Addison Spectator No. 239. ¶3   Socrates introduced a Catechetical Method of Arguing. He would ask his Adversary Question upon Question, till he had convinced him out of his own Mouth that his Opinions were wrong</em>. So I am prepared to accept <strong><em>catechetical</em></strong> as the answer. </p>\n"},{"id":234809,"title":"What is the name of this rhetorical device involving a change of word order?","body":"<p>In the quote below, the two occurrences of <em>again</em> are in different positions in their respective clauses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Forgiveness is the answer to the child's dream of a miracle by which\n  what is broken is made whole <strong>again</strong>, what is soiled is <strong>again</strong> made\n  clean.\" Dag Hammarskjold</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Compare this with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Forgiveness is the answer to the child's dream of a miracle by which\n  what is broken is made whole <strong>again</strong>, what is soiled is made\n  clean <strong>again</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the name of this rhetorical device?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"id":226807,"title":"Word to describe a question with multiple exact correct answers","body":"<p>Not completely sure, but I don't believe <code>ambiguous</code> would qualify for the exact situation I am thinking of, though perhaps I am over thinking this in general.
