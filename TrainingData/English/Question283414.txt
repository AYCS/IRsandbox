And <em>any</em> seems synonymous with <em>every</em> in some examples below, and definitely not in others.</p>\n\n<p><b>On the internet I encountered a German who asked me what the difference is between \"some\" and \"any\".  I didn't have a really good answer.  What I have after thinking about it further is only a bunch of examples (see below).  How might one best explain \"any\" to a foreigner learning English?</b></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Any</strong> six-year-old can do that  </li>\n  <li><p><strong>Every</strong> six-year-old can do that </p></li>\n  <li><p>The answer to that question can be found in <strong>any</strong> book on geology.  </p></li>\n  <li>The answer to that question can be found in <strong>every</strong> book on geology.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are more-or-less synonymous.

It certainly doesn't mean <em>every</em>.  Similarly \"Is anyone home?\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was never any doubt about that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suspect <em>not any</em>, <em>never any</em>, and any number of negative words seem to play a role that must be included in the account of the use of <em>any</em>.  (And that means it must be included in <strong><em>every</em></strong> such account— another instance of <em>any</em> appearing to mean <em>every</em>.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>She can order anything on the menu.</li>\n  <li>She can order everything on the menu.</li>\n  <li>She can order something on the menu.  </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>You can cash this check at any bank.   </li>\n  <li>You can cash this check at every bank.   </li>\n  <li>You can cash this check at some bank.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In these cases, <em>any</em>, <em>every</em>, and <em>some</em> have three quite distinct meanings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>You cannot cash this check at any bank.   </li>\n  <li>You cannot cash this check at every bank.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first of these examples is like the \"never any doubt\" above.</p>\n\n<p>\"Anyone can do that\" might mean \"Everyone can do that\" but \"Can anyone do that?\" means \"Can someone do that?\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Any remembered instance of the old custom is mistaken for a monstrous accident.   </li>\n  <li>Every remembered instance of the old custom is mistaken for a monstrous accident.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first sentence above is quoted from a book by C.
