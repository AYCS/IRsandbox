I’ve been trying to find some explanation for that on the web but with little success.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I found is what follows. I do believe I’m not infringing any copyrights by the looks of the text. I don’t know who wrote it and when though. <a href=\"http://www.bookrags.com/ebooks/17000/9.html\">I took it from here</a>. My notes are italicized.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>8. To clere this point, and alsoe to reform an errour bred in the south, and now usurped be our ignorant printeres, I wil tel quhat befel my self quhen I was in the south with a special gud frende of myne.  Ther rease, upon sum accident, quhither quho, quhen, quhat, etc., sould be symbolized with q or w, a hoat disputation betuene him and me.  After manie conflictes (for we ofte encountered), we met be chance, in the citie of Baeth, with a Doctour of divinitie of both our acquentance.  He invited us to denner.  At table my antagonist, to bring the question on foot amangs his awn condisciples, began that I was becum an heretik, and the doctour spering how, ansuered that I denyed quho to be spelled with a w, but with qu.  Be quhat reason? quod the Doctour.  Here, I beginning to lay my grundes of labial, dental, and guttural [<em>velar?</em>] soundes and symboles, he snapped me on this hand and he on that, that the doctour had mikle a doe to win me room for a syllogisme.  Then (said I) a labial letter can not symboliz a guttural syllab.  But w is a labial letter, quho a guttural sound.  And therfoer w can not symboliz quho, nor noe syllab of that nature.  Here the doctour staying them again (for al barked at ones), the proposition, said he, I understand; the assumption is Scottish, and the conclusion false.  Quherat al laughed, as if I had bene dryven from al replye, and I fretted to see a frivolouse jest goe for a solid ansuer.  My proposition is grounded on the 7 sectio of this same cap., quhilk [<em>whilk=which</em>] noe man, I trow [<em>believe</em>], can denye that ever suked the paepes [<em>I have no idea quhat “suked the paepes” might mean.</em>] of reason.  And soe the question must rest on the assumption quhither w be a labial letter and quho a guttural syllab.  As for w, let the exemples of wil, wel, wyne, juge quhilk are sounded befoer the voual with a mint of the lippes, as is said the same cap., sect. 5. [<em>I don't understand this sentence.</em>] As for quho, besydes that it differres from quo onelie be aspiration, and that w, being noe perfect consonant, can not be aspirated, I appele to al judiciouse eares, to quhilk Cicero attributed mikle, quhither the aspiration in quho be not ex imo [<em>what does</em> ex imo <em>mean</em>?] gutture, and therfoer not labial. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That does seem to give some insight so I would like to divide my question in two parts now. The first part will be about the interpretation of the above, and the second part will be about the spellings in general.</p>\n\n<h2>Part 1.</h2>\n\n<p>I understand that the text is about a discussion between the author on one side and two other people (his friend and the Doctour of divinitie) on the other side. The discussion was about the spelling of the words which have “wh” in them in standard Present-day English. The author said that these words should be spelled with “quh” instead of “wh”. The friend and the Doctour disagreed. The author said that the reason for his conviction that the “quh” spellings are right is that the sound in these word is guttural, which I understand means velar, and not labial.</p>\n\n<p>What was the sound the author used in this word? Was it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labialized_velar_consonant\">[ʍ]</a>? He said the sound was velar, and clearly said it wasn’t labial. Could it mean that he produced a sound that wasn’t labialized? I have never heard of such a realization of this phoneme in any historical dialect of English, but I know very little about these things and it's perfectly possible that it existed from my point of view.</p>\n\n<p>The author seems to have been Scottish. First, he advocates the spellings I have only encountered in Scottish texts, and second, according to the Doctour, he made a “Scottish assumption” about the sound. I think it could mean that the Doctour was English (did he live in Bath?) and used the delabialized allophone. I don’t know when the split occurred, or when the text was written, so I can’t judge whether it’s possible. </p>\n\n<p>He says, “As for quho, besydes that it differres from quo onelie be aspiration, and that w, being noe perfect consonant, can not be aspirated, I appele to al judiciouse eares, to quhilk Cicero attributed mikle, quhither the aspiration in quho be not ex imo gutture, and therfoer not labial.”</p>\n\n<p>I understand the “quo” he’s talking about is the Latin word. I think that this might be a clue that the spellings were a Latin influence, which I thought anyway when I first encountered one. But his explanation of the phonetics is puzzling to me. He says that “quho” and “quo” differ only in aspiration. I will not try to give my guesses about that here because it would make this post even longer than it is. I’ll just ask what he could have meant by that. I know of course that he surely knew less about phonetics than we do now and that he didn’t have our standardized terminology, but he must have meant something, mustn't he? And again, how did he pronounce “quho”?</p>\n\n<h2>Part 2.</h2>\n\n<p>So what were those spellings about? What were their origins? When did they die out? Were they only used in Scotland or in England as well? Why?</p>\n\n<p>Here's another, seemingly related spelling: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>WHEEN</strong>, <em>n</em>.2 I.Sc. form of Eng. <em>queen</em> (Sh. 1825 Jam.; I.Sc. 1866 Edm. <em>Gl</em>.; Sh. 1916 J. Burgess <em>Rasmie’s Smaa Murr</em> (Maerch 20); I.Sc. 1974). See P.L.D. § 165 and <strong>W</strong>, letter, 7. (2) (ii). [ʍin] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This confuses me even more. Was it some kind of hypercorrectness introduced by those who, like the Doctour, didn’t like the spellings with the “q”? It seems rather inconsistent though, as it is not “quheen”, but “queen”.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":37982,"title":"Use of “f ” instead of “s” in historic, printed English documents","body":"<p>I was at a museum in London yesterday, and one of the items on exhibit is a document from the eighteenth century.

Kosmonaut refers to the great number of pictograms (Kanji or Hanzi) available in Japanese and Chinese, and mentions that the task of memorizing our weirdo spellings pales in comparison to learning vocabulary in one of those languages.</p>\n\n<p>That got me to thinking. When I first started studying Japanese, I first learned the two written versions of the syllabary, <em>hiragana</em> and <em>katakana</em>. And when faced with the formidable task of memorizing thousands of characters and their various readings, I wondered why, given the phonetic language, Japanese still stuck with all those originally Chinese characters. Were they just masochists?</p>\n\n<p>But I dug in, and as I learned more and more kanji a strange thing happened. I realized it was actually easier to read the language <em>with</em> the kanji than without them, because so many Japanese words sound alike (or at least their parts do) and to render them in <em>hiragana</em> would force me to slow down and try to figure out which ほう (hou) they meant:\n保, 俸, 倣, 剖, 報, 方, 法 or any of the others. Learning the more complicated writing method actually let me read faster, and to understand words almost pre-apprehensively. By that I mean something a little like looking at the hands of an analog clock and understanding the time without relating it to a numerical equivalent.</p>\n\n<p>Now for English. We have sound-alike words like <em>to</em>, <em>two</em>, and <em>too</em> (or even <em>tu</em>, if you count Shakespeare's imagining of Julius Caesar's dying line). If we went to a strict phonetic spelling system, all those would be spelled the same. I think there are cases where such a thing would actually slow us down. And it may be that the more difficult and idiosyncratic the spelling is, the more likely we are (as Kosmonaut said) to remember it. Further, <em>having</em> remembered it may mean we are more likely to recognize it more easily. Or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>This is just a supposition on my part. It has plausibility and feels right to me, but that doesn't mean it <em>is</em> right. I'd be interested if anyone knows of any information or research done on either side of this argument.</p>\n"},{"id":20803,"title":"Pronunciation of the English alphabet","body":"<p>Why are there inconsistencies in the pronunciation of the consonants of the alphabet?

Characters’ dialogue is written (and spelled) in such a way as to mimic their manner of speech. There are some characters who speak \"common\" english as it might be spoken in London. These characters’ dialogue is written (almost—some words uncommon in my area are employed, but no unorthodox abbreviations or gross misspellings) just as I would write it in America. Others, speak with some flavor of scottish accent, also using some words that might be considered “scottish english.”</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Oo ay, we’re somewhere’s wast’ard o’ the Lewis.
