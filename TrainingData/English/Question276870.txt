E.g. the former sounds wrong, but <em>perhaps</em> the latter inversion does less damage.

The article recognizes two competing notions of the predicate in theories of grammar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(1) Predicates in traditional grammar (e.g., <em>went home</em> in <em>John went home</em>)</p>\n  \n  <p>(2) Predicates in modern theories of syntax and grammar (e.g., <em>went</em> in <em>John went home</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which, according to the article, causes confusion as to what exactly the term predicate mean, and some grammarians came up with a new term \"predicator\" specifically for use (2), says the article. No problem thus far.</p>\n\n<p>What bothers me: The article in its explanation of (2) says, \"Other function words -- e.g. auxiliary verbs, <strong>certain prepositions</strong>, <strong>phrasal particles</strong>, etc. -- are viewed as part of the predicate.\" (Emphasis mine.) </p>\n\n<p>Now, remember this definition of the predicate, i.e., (2) above, corresponds to the new term \"predicator\".</p>\n\n<p>I understand that auxiliary verbs are part of this definition of predicate, because an auxiliary verb can be part of a verb cluster. But can <strong>certain prepositions</strong> and <strong>phrasal particles</strong> also? </p>\n\n<p>The article has these example sentences (Words belonging to \"predicate\" (2) are boldfaced as in the article itself; My comments in parentheses.): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The butter <strong>is in</strong> the drawer.</em> (preposition <strong><em>in</em></strong> being part of the predicate)</p>\n  \n  <p><em>You <strong>should give</strong> it <strong>up</strong>.</em> (particle <strong><em>up</em></strong> being part of the predicate)</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Susan <strong>is pulling</strong> your <strong>leg</strong>.</em> (I don't know why leg is marked as part of the predicate. Maybe a typo?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>QUESTION</h2>\n\n<p>Except for the last one, which I suspect is a typo, I'd like to know whether the preposition <strong><em>in</em></strong> and the particle <strong><em>up</em></strong> belong to the predicate as presented in (2) and thus belong to the new term \"predicator\".</p>\n"},{"id":233533,"title":"Predicate and Verb","body":"<p>What is exactly the difference between Verb and Predicate ? could anybody please tell me clearly and give each example of both ?
