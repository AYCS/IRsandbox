And since there is a common language structure \"pronoun + would rather + verb1 (+ than + verb2)\", like <em>I would rather die (than do it)</em>, I assume that in my example is used some specific shortened form of a more verbose construction, like it's the case with <em>would that i could</em>.

When \"would rather\" is used like in the example above, does it imply some, I don't know how to say it, temporal reference, i.e. <strong>when</strong> the action described by the verb that follows it should happen or should have happened?
