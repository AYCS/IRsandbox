Usually, that means large machinery and non-uniform cargo that won't fit well in a container or would require complicated disassembly in order to do so, but also includes <em>any</em> cargo that is not containerised. (Most of the world's shipped cargo is containerised.)</p>\n\n<p>The shipping company I work at handles a large amount of non-containerised pallets (of fruit commodities--some pallets are containerised, some not; I'm not sure why), large rolls of steel and paper, steel barrels of liquids, plates of steel, and other cargo. We don't have a general term that we can use to generically refer to any specific piece of cargo, which hasn't been a problem in the past, but now that we are consolidating all of our reporting tools into one multi-purpose set of tools, it is. Our old tools were specific to each commodity so we were able to use each term specifically (e.g. pallets), but this won't work with our new generic reporting tools.</p>\n\n<p>Note that \"break-bulk\" is a collective noun that refers to all pieces of break-bulk. To my knowledge, there is no form of the term that can refer to a specific piece or pieces of break-bulk. (i.e. \"One break-bulk\" doesn't make any sense.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a term or word that we can use that refers to one or more pieces of break-bulk?</strong> So far, we've come up with \"cargo unit\", \"main cargo unit\" (as there are also sub-cargo units in the case of pallets), \"typical unit\", and \"cargo measure\", but none of them are particularly elegant or intuitive.</p>\n\n<p>The air-freight industry has the term \"Unit Load Device\" (ULD), but that refers to the very specific metal, pallet-like containers that are built to very specific dimensions to fit tightly in airplanes and doesn't really fit our purposes.</p>\n"},{"id":194948,"title":"An alternative to the word pray, without a religious connotation","body":"<p>When I write, I try my best to leave religion and words that carry some divine connotation out of it.
