I now want to assign a similarly illustrative name to the product of that folding. This word should refer to the whole folded object (red) and ideally neither be usable for the process of folding (blue) or just the point of folding (crease, green), as this could confuse readers.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/NpsM6.png\" alt=\"illustration of a folded something\"></p>\n\n<p>I have considered the following words so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><em>fold</em></strong> – while this word can indeed be used for what I need, it can also be used for the point of folding (green). Still, I consider this one of the better choices for now.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>foldth</em></strong> – a neologism in analogy to <em>warm → warmth, break → breach, grow → growth</em> and similar. However, there are also <em>strong → strength, wide → width</em> and similar, which work differently. Being a new word, it cannot be confused for something else but may be confusing due to being new, in particular as the morphology behind this feels rather old and unproductive to me. Also, the <em>ldth</em> sequence may be difficult to pronounce for some (there is no English word containing this sequence).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>folding</em></strong> – fits in analogy to <em>build → building</em> or <em>scaffolding.</em> However, it can also be applied to the process of folding (blue).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>origami</em></strong> – quite illustrative, but not morphologically related to <em>to fold.</em> Also, it might be considered silly by readers.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>foldee</em></strong> – something I would use for some<strong>one</strong> who is being folded. Yet it does not quite fit for some<strong>thing</strong> that is being folded. Moreover it rather describes the object of the folding, not the result (compare to <em>examinee</em> vs. <em>graduate</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>foldery</em></strong> – a neologism in analogy to <em>bake → bakery, flatter → flattery</em> and similar. Does not really fit as I would rather use it for a place where folding happens or for intensive or repeated folding.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>folder</em></strong> – does not really fit as it rather describes somebody or something that folds.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am wondering whether I missed some better option.
