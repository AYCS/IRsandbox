Sometimes connected to root *<em>men</em>- \"to think\" (see <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mind&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong><em>mind</em></strong></a>), which would make the ground sense of <em>man</em> \"one who has intelligence,\" but not all linguists accept this. Liberman, for instance, writes, \"Most probably man 'human being' is a secularized divine name\" from <em>Mannus</em> [Tacitus, \"<em>Germania</em>,\" chap. 2], \"believed to be the progenitor of the human race.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am as he that seythe, `Come hyddr John, my man.' [1473]</p>\n  \n  <p>Sense of \"adult male\" is late (c. 1000); Old English used <em>wer</em> and <em>wif</em> to distinguish the sexes, but <em>wer</em> began to disappear late 13c. and was replaced by <em>man</em>. Universal sense of the word remains in <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mankind&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">mankind</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=manslaughter&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">manslaughter</a></em></strong>. Similarly, Latin had <em>homo</em> \"human being\" and <em>vir</em> \"adult male human being,\" but they merged in Vulgar Latin, with <em>homo</em> extended to both senses. A like evolution took place in Slavic languages, and in some of them the word has narrowed to mean \"husband.\" PIE had two stems: *<em>uiHro</em> \"freeman\" (source of Sanskrit <em>vira</em>-, Lithuanian <em>vyras</em>, Latin <em>vir</em>, Old Irish <em>fer</em>, Gothic <em>wair</em>) and *<em>hner</em> \"man,\" a title more of honor than *<em>uiHro</em> (source of Sanskrit <em>nar</em>-, Armenian <em>ayr</em>, Welsh <em>ner</em>, Greek <em>aner</em>).</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANTRAP, a woman's commodity. [Grose, \"Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue,\" London, 1785]</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Man</em> also was in Old English as an indefinite pronoun, \"one, people, they.\" The chess pieces so called from c. 1400. As an interjection of surprise or emphasis, first recorded c. 1400, but especially popular from early 20c. <em>Man-about-town</em> is from 1734; <em>the Man</em> \"the boss\" is from 1918. To be <em>man</em> or <em>mouse</em> \"be brave or be timid\" is from 1540s. <em>Men's Liberation</em> first attested 1970.</p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the kinges court, my brother, Ech man for himself. [Chaucer, \"Knight's Tale,\" c. 1386]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this there does not seem to be any relation between \"man\" and \"human\" because one is Germanic and one is Latin. It seems to me that the \"man\" in human is just a phonetic shift from ho<em>mun</em>culus. It could also be possible that both words are derived from the respective culture's origin of man.

Why are these sentences basically equivalents? Why is \"that's the man who killed her\" closer to what we want to convey rather than \"that's the man who kills her\" when we say \"that man is her killer\"? I don't see how one sentence like \"that man is her killer\" can imply both habitual and non-habitual actions. If you say \"That man is the bathroom's cleaner\" then it's implied that he cleans the bathroom habitually, but if you say \"That man is the company's founder\" then you don't imply he habitually founds the company where he constantly tears it down and founds it again. </p>\n"},{"id":233978,"title":"What is &#39;man flu&#39;?","body":"<p>I had been under the apparent misapprehension that the term <strong><em>man flu</em></strong> was used to distinguish it from <strong><em>bird flu</em></strong> or <strong><em>swine flu</em></strong> etc. </p>\n\n<p>But according to Wikipedia this is how it is described.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Man flu is a pejoratively used phrase that refers to the idea that\n  men, when they have a cold, exaggerate and claim they have the flu.\n  Whilst a commonly used phrase in the UK and Ireland, it is referred to\n  in other cultures[1] and there is a continuing discussion over the\n  scientific basis for the phrase.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A couple of people have recently told me they had <em>man flu</em>.
