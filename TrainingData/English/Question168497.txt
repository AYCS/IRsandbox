For instance, <em>this is a dog</em> translates to <em>das ist ein Hund</em>, and <em>ein</em> here is in the nominative. In German, <a href=\"http://german.stackexchange.com/a/7632/8837\">this</a> seems related to what the subject of the sentence is.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I was thinking about this and wondered about why in constructions like <em>it is [inflected pronoun]</em>, using the nominative case for the pronoun instead of an objective case seems slightly overly formal.</p>\n\n<p>That's not to say that the nominative case is never used. For instance, from the book of John:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then Jesus, knowing all that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, “Whom are you looking for?” They answered, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus replied, “I am he.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(This is from the New Revised Standard Version, but the King James Version gives the same.) Now, this seems grammatically correct to me, but it probably seem unnatural to the casual listener if, upon asking who Jane Doe is, I answered with \"I am she\" instead of \"I'm her.\"</p>\n\n<p>Why is this the case? Has this just always been the case in more informal English?

The objective is to find the phrase that is incorrectly used.

My thinking was to use 'us' instead of 'we'. However, the answer in the back of the book says the answer is:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>E. There is no error in the sentence as written. The <em>we</em> in (D) may sound strange, but the subject pronoun is correct here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can someone please explain this to me?
