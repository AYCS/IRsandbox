[{"id":296321,"title":"Word-formation process - which one?","body":"<p>I would like to ask if anyone knows what word-formation process takes place when we join two separate words (for instance 360 + flip) and create a word '360 flip' written separately, but used as a single noun (He did a beautiful 360 flip trick). I know that <em>compounding</em> means the joining of two separate words to produce a single form, but this is different because in my example we do not have one single form.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":286064,"title":"Morphological analysis of the formation of unhappier","body":"<p>I am an English student from Austria and have a question concerning morphology.</p>\n\n<p>In the reading I did for one of my introductory courses on linguistics there was a chapter on the analysis of word-formation and which affixes get attached to the word first (in Plag et al. 2009). He explained it quite well that one should have a look at the meaning of the word to discern of how many components it consists. His example was 'unfearful' and it was easy to understand why fearful was formed first, after which the prefix un- can be added.</p>\n\n<p>So, now I ask, what happens if you have a word like 'unhappier' which in my analysis consists of the adjective happy, a suffix for the comparative and a prefix for the negation. Is there any way to analyse whether unhappy or happier was formed first? Or is this a stupid question, because the comparative does not create a now word per se, rather changes it's grammatical function?</p>\n"},{"id":264164,"title":"Person, People, Peoples, and other linguistically similar words","body":"<p>Now, person is singular, and can decline to the plural persons or people, depending on region, level of formality, and nuance. Let's ignore persons for the moment and just focus on people. People, when used as a singular collective noun, can further decline to the plural peoples. For example, I could say that I am a person from Gillikin Country, which has many people, and all of them are part of the peoples of Oz. </p>\n\n<p>Now, my question is this: are there any other words that behave this way?
