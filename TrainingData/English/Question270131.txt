My girlfriend would not use it to refer to any event that happened less recently than last month. Neither of us is a native speaker of English, so I would like to ask:   which understanding is closer to common English usage?   <strong>When is an event so old that the phrase \"the other day\" no longer applies?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note: I understand that phrases like this are of course not clearly defined and usage may depend on the speaker and the context. But nevertheless there must be some kind of vague time frame at work here; one would not say that an event which happened twenty years ago happened the other day, but it would be fine to say so if it happened a week ago. So what I want to know is if there exists a bit tighter limit on this time frame.</p>\n"},{"id":237509,"title":"The usage of &quot;got out&quot; and the indefinite article &quot;a&quot; in the sentence &quot;if it got out that they were related to a pair of&quot;","body":"<p>I'm a English learner and I found the following sentence which seemed strange to me when I was reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Chapter one, the American Edition): \"if it got out that they were related to a pair of ——well, he didn't think he could bear it.\"</p>\n\n<p>My first problem is that I don't know why \"got out\" is used here.
