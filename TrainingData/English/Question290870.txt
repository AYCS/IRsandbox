According to some English dictionaries, 'other than' is a phrase, and so I think 'other' and 'than' should not be separated. However, after Googling, I found expressions like 'any other something than something' is more popular. For example, 'Is there any other option than abortion' was widely used, where as 'Is there any option other than abortion' was rare. </p>\n\n<p>In the preceding example, why the 'other' in 'any option other than abortion' is moved forward to form 'any other option than abortion'? Maybe the author wanted to emphasize 'other', so 'any' and 'other' were put together.</p>\n\n<p>Q2: Is sentence 3 correct? In this sentence, there are two 'other's. I feel that this sentence is very odd, although there is no grammatical problem.  </p>\n"},{"id":17672,"title":"What is the difference between &quot;exemption&quot; and &quot;exception&quot;?","body":"<p>It seems that <em>exemption</em> and <em>exception</em> have the same meaning.
