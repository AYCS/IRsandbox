[{"id":252321,"title":"Present perfect or simple present in relative clauses- British English","body":"<p>Might I pose yet another question on the (tedious?) subject of the contrast between present perfect and simple past? I have been asked if the following sentence should be:</p>\n\n<p>\"This is the report I prepared\" or </p>\n\n<p>\"This is the report I have prepared\".</p>\n\n<p>The situational context would have been the start of a meeting, but I have no details as to what was said before the sentence at hand. However, I would suppose that the audience knew in advance of the data and expected the speaker to brief them about the document at some point.</p>\n\n<p>My initial response was that the present perfect is not strictly necessary here. Or rather, as I told my student, the inflectional past \"I prepared\" is better in this relative clause. </p>\n\n<p>Now in terms of the rules of thumb traditionally given to learners at intermediate level, actually there are more than enough reasons to justify the use of the present perfect: the time when the work was done is not specified, the report was obviously completed and there was now-relevance at the moment of speaking. My student was right to appear confused.</p>\n\n<p>I have since been trying to rationalise my reaction and determine if mine was a valid intuition or just a knee-jerk, irrational response to bad pronunciation (as in \"the report I HAVE prepared\", the auxiliary being unduly marked) I know that in AE it is quite acceptable to use the simple past in many cases where BE prefers the present perfect. But I would like to know what the use of the preterite in the above case implies to BE speakers, if it doesn't sound downright wrong.\n(This post has been edited to clarify question and context.)</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":268399,"title":"Past simple Vs Present Perfect (obviously)","body":"<p>I have read this text about a man who has spent a terrible holiday (in the island of Thassos) due to the disorganisation of the travel company.

Currently I'm reading English Grammar in Use (2nd Edition Cambridge Press â€” Intermediate level). At page 14 here is what we can read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note the difference between <strong>gone (to)</strong> and <strong>been (to)</strong>:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Jim is away on holiday. He has <strong>gone to</strong> Spain. ( = <strong>he is there now or on his way there</strong>)</li>\n  <li>Jane is back home from holiday now. She has <strong>been to</strong> Italy. (= <strong>she has now come back from Italy</strong>)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I understand from the above example is that when we use <strong>gone to a location</strong> the person <strong>is still in that location or is heading there at the time of speaking.</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the contrary when we use <strong>been to a location</strong> the person <strong>is no more at that location at the time of speaking (now)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Then, at the next chapter there was the following exercise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Read the situations and write sentences as shown in the example:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Jack is driving a car but he's very nervous and not sure what to do.</p>\n  \n  <p>You ask: Have you driven a car before?</p>\n  \n  <p>He says: No this is the first time I've driven a car.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Maria is in London. She has just arrived and it's very new for her.</p>\n  \n  <p>You ask:  ..................................................</p>\n  \n  <p>She says: ..................................................</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is how I answered the 2nd Exercise.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You ask: Have you been in London before?</p>\n  \n  <p>She says: No this is the first time I've been in London</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason of my choice was the following: </p>\n\n<p><strong>gone to</strong> doesn't seem to be appropriate as it indicates just some movement/motion, a trip to London rather than a long/short stay in London. </p>\n\n<p>Also <strong>been to</strong> cannot work because if we use it that would mean that <strong>Maria is no more in London now</strong> and she has come back. I arrive at this conclusion based on the example in the grammar book that I provided above (Jane has come back from Italy)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore I thought using <strong>been in</strong> London would be the best choice.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I checked the answer at the end of the book, the suggested solution was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li><p>Maria is in London. She has just arrived and it's very new for her.</p>\n  \n  <p>You ask:  Have you <strong>been to</strong> London before?</p>\n  \n  <p>She says: No, this is the first time I've <strong>been to</strong> London</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really don't understand the choice of <strong>been to</strong> here. It has been specified explicitly at the beginning of the exercise: \"Maria is in London\". So if at the moment of speaking she is in London how it is possible to use <strong>been to</strong>. Wouldn't <strong>been in</strong> be more appropriate in this context? </p>\n\n<p>Could you kindly make some clarification on this?</p>\n"},{"id":225404,"title":"Present Perfect vs. Present Perfect Continuous","body":"<p>how are you?</p>\n\n<p>Well, my biggest doubt at the moment is the difference between these two tenses.
