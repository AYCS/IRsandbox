For example, Americans…</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>drop the \"h\" on \"herb\" and \"Beethoven\";</li>\n<li>rhyme \"fillet\" and \"valet\" with \"parlay\" as opposed to \"skillet\"; and</li>\n<li>pronounce paella as /paɪˈeɪə/ (approximating a Castilian or Mexican accent), whereas the British pronounce it as /pʌɪˈɛlə/.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In general, the British seem to pronounce foreign/loan words as they would be phonetically pronounced if they were English, whereas Americans tend to approximate the original pronunciation.  I've heard some people claim that this trend is due to the melting pot nature of America, and others claim that the French pronunciation, in particular, is due to America's very close relations with France during its infancy.  This latter hypothesis, however, seems to be contradicted by the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Avoid the habit of employing French words in English conversation; it is in extremely bad taste to be always employing such expressions as <em>ci-devant</em>, <em>soi-disant</em>, <em>en masse</em>, <em>couleur de rose</em>, etc. Do not salute your acquaintances with <em>bon jour</em>, nor reply to every proposition, <em>volontiers</em>.  In speaking of French cities and towns, it is a mark of refinement in education to pronounce them rigidly according to English rules of speech. Mr. Fox, the best French scholar, and one of the best bred men in England, always sounded the x\n  in <em>Bourdeaux</em>, and the s in <em>Calais</em>, and on all occasions pronounced such names just as they are written.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/letiq10h.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">THE LAWS OF ETIQUETTE; or, Short Rules and Reflections for CONDUCT IN SOCIETY</a>.

It is interesting to note that there seems to be a trend in U English to substitute words that have an obvious counterpart in French with words that are either of Germanic origin or those that do not have a direct equivalent in modern French.  For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>scent</em> is preferred over <em>perfume</em>;</li>\n<li><em>looking glass</em> is preferable to <em>mirror</em>;</li>\n<li><em>false teeth</em> is preferable to <em>dentures</em>;</li>\n<li><em>graveyard</em> > <em>cemetery</em>;</li>\n<li><em>napkin</em> > <em>serviette</em>;</li>\n<li><em>lavatory</em> > <em>toilet</em>;</li>\n<li><em>drawing-room</em> > <em>lounge</em>;</li>\n<li><em>lunch</em> > <em>dinner</em> (for a midday meal); and</li>\n<li><em>what?</em> > <em>pardon?</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is admittedly a stretch, but perhaps there is some connection between the US's lack (and some might say derision) of a noble class and its preference toward non-U/French pronunciation?</p>\n"},{"id":10155,"title":"Data pronunciation: &quot;dayta&quot; or &quot;dahta&quot;?","body":"<p>I hear \"dayta\" more often, but what's the correct pronunciation?</p>\n"},{"id":223633,"title":"Pronunciation of Fete as in Village Fete","body":"<p>I don't know how this site appeared in my pc, but I was using an old pc.

The owner of the gallery, Paul (who has a mild southern accent, similar to Matthew McConaughey), pronounced it the same way during several shots of him filmed after the auction, and numerous other times during the episode. In fact, in one scene, Paul pronounced it like that in front of a musical-instrument expert who was called in to appraise it, but the expert did not correct him (I note that the expert did not say the word at all throughout the segment, possibly to avoid embarrassing Paul on television).</p>\n\n<p>Two of the bidders also pronounced it like that as did the owner again.</p>\n\n<p>I particularly noted the pronunciation because this show was the third time this week that I heard it pronounced this way.
