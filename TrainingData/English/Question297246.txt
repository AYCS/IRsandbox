[{"id":297246,"title":"To share something without giving it away physically?","body":"<p>In its probably original sense, <strong>to share</strong> means to <em>divide something among people</em>.

The metaphor is used at times to bestialize/animalize the acts of the Nazis and, in some cases, to show the arbitrary nature of the classes/groups/divisions they and others applied to human beings.</p>\n\n<p>I considered \"chremamorphism,\" but this describes the attribution of the characteristics of an object to, or the objectification of, a human. I also considered \"animalize\" and \"bestialize,\" but those describe some of the effects that can be produced by Spiegelman's metaphor, not the metaphor itself - in many scenes in the book, the characters are extremely human, and I think that the negative or degrading connotations of these words makes them inappropriate for this use. Nor do \"anthropomorphism\" or \"personification\" fit, because Spiegelman is not applying human characteristics to animals but the other way around. None of the words that I can think of quite fit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a word that accurately describes Art Spiegelman's depiction of obviously human characters as having animal body parts or wearing animal masks in the comic book <em>Maus</em>?</strong></p>\n"},{"id":279071,"title":"Whats a word for someone who verbally and physically abuses others without remorse excessively?","body":"<p>There's a mother I know who saw nothing wrong with physically whipping her own son naked for at least 13 minutes everyday of his kindergarten year.
