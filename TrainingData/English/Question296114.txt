My first question: am I correct?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it seems like I can easily add the verb to be right after <strong>the aggregate functions</strong>, thus making it mean basically the same thing but, at the same time, making it much more easier to understand:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While it may be obvious to you that you want the aggregate functions <strong>to be applied</strong> to each set of products found in the account table, this query fails because...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which now does make perfect sense.
