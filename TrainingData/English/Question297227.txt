Kipling is talking to a man named Gobind. \"Even so\" occurs five parapgraphs down.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‘And what,’ said Gobind one Sunday afternoon, ‘is your honoured craft, and by what manner of means earn you your daily bread?’</p>\n  \n  <p>‘I am,’ said I, ‘a kerani – one who writes with a pen upon paper, not being in the service of the Government.’</p>\n  \n  <p>‘Then what do you write?’ said Gobind. ‘Come nearer, for I cannot see your countenance, and the light fails.’</p>\n  \n  <p>‘I write about all matters that lie within my understanding, and of many that are not. But chiefly I write of Life and Death, and of men and women, and Love and Fate according to the measure of my ability, telling the tale through the mouths of one, two, or more people. Then by the favour of God money accrues to me that I may keep alive.’</p>\n  \n  <p>'<strong>Even so</strong>,' said Gobind. 'That is the work of the bazar story−teller; but he speaks straight to men and women and does not write anything at all. Only when the tale has aroused expectation, and calamities are about to befall the virtuous, he stops suddenly and demands payment ere he continues the narration. Is it so in your craft, my son?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, it is a full stop after “ ‘Even so,’ said Gobind.” So it looks a thought it means something other than “nevertheless” or “that being the case.\" Can anyone help?</p>\n\n<p>There is another instance in the same book, in “Little Tobrah. Little Tobrah has just mentioned a little sister. Then it goes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‘She who was found dead in the well?’ said one who had heard something of the trial. ‘Even so,’ said Little Tobrah gravely. ‘She who was found dead in the well.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, I think it clearly means “yes” or “exactly.” Can anyone help me with the first quote? Kipling often puts unusual, somewhat archaic, I think, constructions in the mouth of Indians. It is possibly the case here.</p>\n"},{"id":255759,"title":"What does &quot;delinquent&quot; mean in this context?","body":"<p>I'm more or less aware of the meanings of the word <em>delinquent</em>. However, I can't decide what it exaclty means in the following quote which is from god is not Great by Christopher Hitchens and where he discusses the child abuse among clergymen: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sometimes the resulting frustration expressed itself in horrible excesses of corporal punishment, which is bad enough in itself. But when the artificial inhibitions really collapse, as we have seen them do, they result in behavior which no average masturbating, fornicating sinner could even begin to contemplate without horror. This is not the result of a few <strong><em>delinquents</em></strong> among the shepherds, but an outcome of an ideology which sought to establish clerical control by means of control of the sexual instinct and even of the sexual organs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know \"delinquent\" doesn't have hundreds of meanings but I know it is used for \"an (especially young/teenager) offender of a minor crime\" and \"failure to perform one's duty\". Since I think there are no teenage clergymen to guard the children, I am confused about what the word \"deliquent\" really means here. Maybe it means \"negligence\"?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"id":137791,"title":"The meaning of &quot;Mid or feed&quot;","body":"<p>What does the expression \"Mid or feed\" mean?
