That preference is even more marked with, say, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=friend%20of%20America,friend%20of%20America%27s&amp;year_start=1700&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\">friend of America</a>. Not that I think the usage itself is particularly American - it's much the same with <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=friend%20of%20Britain,friend%20of%20Britain%27s&amp;year_start=1700&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\">Britain</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I find <em>friend of him</em> grates. In general I've no strong feelings either way as to whether it's <em>friend of Peter</em> or <em>friend of Peter's</em> (though I deplore the possessive in <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/50576/isnt-the-expression-im-not-inclined-to-be-a-supporter-of-newt-gingrichs-hav\">this example</a>), but in line with many others, I really don't like the possessive in relation to things like countries.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this? </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Noting an apparent \"progression\" (pronoun -> person -> nation) marked by reduction in use of the possessive, I checked at a finer \"granularity\". NGram shows that although it does occur, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=friend%20of%20mine,friend%20of%20me&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\">friend of me</a> virtually \"flatlines\" against <em>friend of mine</em>. But the bias reduces through <em>of you, of us,</em> and by the time I get to <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=friend%20of%20them,friend%20of%20theirs&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\">of them</a> it's much less extreme. There seems to be something \"egocentric\" about the double possessive.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably when babies learn to speak, they soon notice that possessive pronouns, possessive apostrophes, and the word \"of\", all do the same job. Parents would correct a child who says <em>\"of mine's\"</em>, but probably wouldn't even notice the same \"redundancy\" in <em>\"of Peter's\"</em>. Younger speakers are unlikely to even be talking about something <em>\"of America's\"</em>. Perhaps as we mature we tend to discard the \"double possessive\" for the more \"distant\" things that only adults are likely talk about, but we keep it for \"closer\" people because that's how we spoke when we were younger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT2</strong> I note that <em>I'm a great fan of him</em> is vanishingly rare compared to <em>...fan of his</em>, but with <strong>...fan</strong> <em>(of John)</em> the double possessive occurs far less often than <strong>...friend</strong> <em>(of John's)</em>. Usage seems to be affected by the noun <strong>before</strong> \"of\" as well as the one <strong>after</strong> it.
