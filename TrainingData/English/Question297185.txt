Why hasn't anyone done this before? I thought. Then I realised what you wouldn't be able to do in the third book. In the first, you could say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He walked along the street.

Has there ever been any such tense in the English language, or is there some sort of substitute for one? The closest I've come up with is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He will walk along the street. He will have just left his house, and later it will be going to be burgled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... which is cumbersome to say the least!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: my example was badly chosen, because of the adverb 'later'. Since I'm toying with the idea of a <em>whole book</em> written in the future tense (or 'tense' if you don't count periphrastic tenses as tenses :-) ), I'm looking for something that works in general, not just for this sentence. A better example is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He left his house, but he would return / He leaves his house, but he will return.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now 'He will leave his house, but he will return' doesn't really work.</p>\n"},{"id":285935,"title":"Why the future tense?","body":"<p>When we have trouble with starting a car we say \"Oh no, the car won't start.\" \nWhy do we use future tense here? </p>\n"},{"id":232321,"title":"Future Progressive tense","body":"<p>I'm quite good at English,but not adept in it.

For example, it can form a possessive either by using an old case inflection:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>dog’s</strong> tail was always wagging.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or it can do so periphrastically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The tail <strong>of the dog</strong> was always wagging.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those are both possessives, the one an inflectional possessive and the other a periphrastic possessive.  The same appears to be possible with tenses, too, not just with possessives. In Jeremy Butterfield’s <em>The Arguments of Time</em> (OUP 2006), he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A tense is <em>inflectional</em> if it is realized as an affix on a head (in English, a verb), <em>periphrastic</em> if it is realized as an independent word. Thus the English past is inflectional, but the future is periphrastic, co-opting the modal <em>will</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This accords with the OED’s definition of <em>tense</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Gram.</em>  Any one of the different forms or modifications <strong>(or word-groups)</strong> in\n  the conjugation of a verb which indicate the different times (past,\n  present, or future) at which the action or state denoted by it is viewed as\n  happening or existing, and also (by extension) the different nature of\n  such action or state, as continuing (imperfect) or completed (perfect);\n  also <em>abstr.</em> that quality of a verb which depends on the expression of such\n  differences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, one of the citations under that sense draws attention to this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The <strong>tenses of the English verb</strong> are made partly by inflection, partly by the use of <strong>auxiliary verbs</strong>.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, <em>tense</em> cannot be just an alias for “inflection” as some here have been saying. At least, not if the sources cited above are to be believed.</p>\n\n<h2>And my question is. . .</h2>\n\n<p>Aren’t these <strong><em>all</em></strong> tenses, both the  inflectional<sup>1</sup> tenses  and the periphrastic<sup>2</sup> tenses alike?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub>1. <em>Inflectional</em> tenses are sometimes also known as <em>synthetic</em> tenses.<br>\n2. <em>Periphrastic</em> tenses are sometimes also known as <em>analytic</em> tenses, or <em>analytical</em> tenses — or sometimes, <em>compound</em> tenses.</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>When did compound tenses stop being tenses?  Or have they? Isn’t that what these people who pretend that ‘English has no future tense’ are actually saying, that periphrastic tenses are not tenses?</p>\n\n<p>If so, then the OED does not support the notion.  Under their definition of <em>periphrastic</em>. . . </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of the nature of, characterized by, or involving periphrasis; circumlocutory; roundabout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>. . . they have a note, which covers both verbs and possessives:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><em><strong>periphrastic conjugation</em></strong> (in Grammar), a conjugation formed by the combination of a simple verb and an auxiliary, as distinct from a \n  simple formation from the verb-stem.  <br></li>\n  <li><em><strong>periphrastic genitive</em></strong>, an equivalent of the genitive case, formed by aid of a preposition, as \n  <i>of</i> in Eng., \n  <i>de</i> in Fr.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So periphrastic forms seem real, whether as tenses or genitives.  I do not see how <em>periphrastic</em> started to mean ersatz or bogus or fake.  So why have some people begun to treat periphrastic tenses as fake tenses?  No, they aren’t inflectional tenses, but why does this matter?  Other languages have plenty of kinds of periphrastic tenses, and nobody discounts them there.  So why have they started trying to discount them in English?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Other Tongues</h2>\n\n<p>If one were allowed to bring Romance into the picture, then it might be useful to point out that sometimes both inflectional and periphrastic versions of the same tense exist, and that nobody there ever pretends one is a tense and the other is not.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In Latin, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_conjugation#Periphrastic_conjugations\">periphrastic conjugations</a> existed, allowing you to use <em>portātūrus sum</em> for “I’m going to carry”, which coëxists with the purely inflectional future, <em>portābō</em>.  This is like how in modern Romance you can have both an inflectional future tense (FR <em>je porterai</em>; ES <em>portaré</em>) and a periphrastic future tense (FR <em>je vais porter</em>; ES <em>voy a portar</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>In French, for example, you can put a present-tense sentence like <em>je porte</em> into the past in either of two equivalent ways: via the passé composé with <em>j’ai porté</em> or via the passé simple with <em>je portai</em>.  No one calls the first one present tense there, because it is not perceived as such. Similarly, the pluperfect exists only as a compound/periphrastic tense in French, but <em>j’avais porté</em> is not called the past tense (even though <em>avais</em> itself is in the imparfait), but rather the pluperfect, the plus-que-parfait.</p></li>\n<li><p>In Spanish, there are two versions of the pluperfect tense, a rare inflectional one and a common periphrastic one.  The compound version of the pluperfect indicative is <em>había portado</em>, whereas the purely inflectional version is <em>portara</em> (which is normally one of the two imperfect subjunctives). Those are both considered to be in the pluperfect.  Nobody calls <em>había portado</em> as being in the imperfect just because <em>había</em> is; that would be wrong: it is in the pluperfect.</p></li>\n<li><p>In modern Romance, the inflectional future and the inflectional conditional were once periphrastic tenses but are now inflectional ones.  The present-tense auxiliary was used for the then-compound future, and the imperfect-tense auxiliary was used for the then-compound conditional.  Specifically, they used either a present-tense or past-tense form of <em>to have</em>, inflected for person and number, appended to the infinitive.  Eventually this became fused in writing — completely fused in most of them but only partially fused in Portuguese, where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitic#Mesoclitic\">mesoclitics</a> are still permitted.  The compound tense did not suddenly become a “real” tense just when people stopped writing it with a space, nor does it cease to be one when in Portuguese a mesoclitic intervenes.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>See also</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/q/86812/2085\">Whose tense is it, anyway?</a></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":138240,"title":"Present tense vs. future tense following a conditional","body":"<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>If you ask without any background, many people <em>are</em> likely to assume you are just too lazy to do the work yourself.</li>\n  <li>If you ask without any background, many people <em>will</em> likely assume you are just too lazy to do the work yourself.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shouldn't (2) be better than (1)?</p>\n\n<p>I searched for \"future tense vs. present tense\", but didn't find anything helpful in reference to the posed problem. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I found on <a href=\"http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/conditional2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">grammar.ccc</a> that an '<em>if</em> + present tense' clause should be followed by a main clause of the form '<em>will</em> + infinitive/present tense/imperative'; so, at least according to that reliable source, (1) would be wrong.</p>\n"},{"id":132256,"title":"Weird future tense usage","body":"<p>I am now reading <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0137081073\">The Clean Coder</a> book and have noticed a couple of cases of weird (for non-native speaker) future tense usages.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The point of the kata is to train your fingers and your brain. <strong>I'll\ndo a kata or two every day</strong>, often as part of settling to work.
