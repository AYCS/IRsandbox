Can someone please help me understand why choice (C) is offered as the correct answer? I know my confusion stems from my faulty analysis of the argument (attached at the end), but I am just unable to identify the gaps of reason from here. I would appreciate any insight on the matter.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Over the last several decades, the demand for Country Y’s auto-mobiles increased in Country X but demand for Country X’s auto-mobiles in Country Y has remained stagnant. Initially, this disparity was plausibly due to Y’s manufacturers having superior technology, which has yielded more fuel efficient cars with cheaper maintenance. However, now Country X’s cars are comparable—if not slightly superior—in these respects. What Country X’s manufacturers fail to acknowledge is that Country Y’s drivers drive on the left side of the road. Clearly, to help lessen this trade imbalance, Country X manufacturers should produce more cars with right-side steering wheels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Which of the following is an assumption made by the argument?</strong></p>\n\n<p>(A) Reversing the trade imbalance requires making [right-hand-drive cars].</p>\n\n<p>(B) If Country X makes auto-mobiles with right-side steering wheels, most consumers from Country Y will chose to purchase a car from Country X.</p>\n\n<p>(C) If consumers from Country Y drive on the left side of the road, these consumers are less inclined to buy [cars built with] steering wheels on the left-side of the car.</p>\n\n<p>(D) Cars from Country X will continue to improve their fuel efficiency and reduce their maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>(E) The government of Country Y requires all its citizens to purchase cars with right-side steering wheels.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My Analysis:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:  <em>to help lessen the trade imbalance, country X's manufacturers should produce more cars with right-side steering wheels.</em></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Premise No.1</strong>: <em>country X's manufacturers have upgraded their technology and cut their maintenance costs to match that of country Y's manufacturers, but there still exists a trade imbalance</em></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Premise No.2</strong>: <em>country Y's drivers drive on the left side of the road.</em></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>trade balance, and therefore offsetting any imbalance, is dependent on the manufacturer's technology, maintenance cost, and assigned location of the steering wheel.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Answer Key Explanation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Choice (A) is not necessary—it strengthens the argument. In fact, it guarantees that the  conclusion is true, but it’s not the assumption. I don’t need reversing the trade imbalance to require the plan advocated in the passage. I only need the plan to help lessen the imbalance. The same problem exists in choice (B): I don’t need most consumers from Y to purchase cars from X in order to help lessen the trade imbalance. Choice (C) says that if they are not inclined to buy them, then the plan is no good. Thus, this is essential to the plan working. Choice D is not necessary: I don’t need Country X’s cars to continue to improve. I only need them to continue to be comparable to Country Y’s cars. Choice (E) makes me like the plan but it is not essential. I don’t need the preference for right side steering wheels to be government-mandated. </p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":38569,"title":"Name for relation between a man’s two wives?","body":"<p>What is the relation between the two wives of a man called?</p>\n"},{"id":93722,"title":"Word for &quot;drawing a decisive conclusion about a phenomenon according to specific personal experience&quot;","body":"<p>What is a single word for \"drawing a decisive conclusion about a phenomenon according to specific personal experience\"?</p>\n\n<p>I often encounter people who can follow a pattern like that in an argument:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A: What do you think about the new X cell phone?</p>\n  \n  <p>B: My sister bought one, and she could not operate it, so it's not\n  user friendly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's not only generalization, but also taking a case that you are familiar with and making conclusions about a certain object according to that case even if the conclusion is not relevant or connected.</p>\n"},{"id":76358,"title":"What are the names of the two sides of a coin?","body":"<p>I know one side is called 'flower'.

So let's say I have options a, b and c, and 9 coins, I balance my coins and assign: a:3, b:3, c:3.</p>\n\n<p>Leverage means to use a little amount of resources to obtain a greater amount of those resources. Let's say I have 9 coins again and the expected profit of a, b and c is a:10/1, b:10/3, c:5/1. In this case I'll choose to put my 9 coins on a, because I can leverage up to 90 (it would be 30 for b and 45 for c).</p>\n\n<p>So far so good. Now there are two alternative explanations for what I'm searching for:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Now let's say that a, b and c have some admittance or a maximum number of coins that can be assigned before becoming ineffective. These numbers can be a:2, b:8, c:4. In this case we will obviously make the following assignment: a:2, b:3, c:4. This is not so clear when there is not a hard number where assignments become ineffective but slopes that can be more or less steep. Therefore this would require an assignment of the resources that doesn't balance among the options and does not leverage, since the multiplier factor was lost.</li>\n<li>Alternatively let's say a, b and c have different risks, more profitability means a higher risk. So we want to balance profitability with exposure to risk, and we don't want to leverage or balance our investment but to do something different (that's the word I'm looking for), let's say that considering the risks (which I don't state, imagine we are making the decision right according to some rules) we assign: a:2, b:6, c:1.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In this case we are not balancing and I would say we are not leveraging, but assigning the coins to resources a, b and c in a different way. I'm searching for such a word. I hope it exists.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if I'm not clear, it's a quite specific concept that arises in a fairly specific context, please ask if there is something that needs clarification.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n"},{"id":50293,"title":"&quot;You can add more at the end of this list BUT before making a new entry make sure its not already present&quot;","body":"<p>This is a tip that is being included with an Excel form, which requires the end user to fill some technical information.
