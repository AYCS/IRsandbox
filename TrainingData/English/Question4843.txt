[{"id":4843,"title":"History: Relationship between happy and lucky","body":"<p>Why are the words happy and lucky so closely related, historically? Looking at the etymology, the <strong>hap</strong> in <strong>happy</strong> is the same as in <strong>happenstance</strong>, <strong>happen</strong>, <strong>hapless</strong>, etc. The etymology, according to <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hap?r=75&amp;src=ref&amp;ch=dic\">dictionary.com</a> is \"ME &lt; ON happ luck, chance.\"</p>\n\n<p>What also makes me ask this is that it seems to be the case in other languages, as well. For example, in German, <strong>gluecklich</strong> still means both happy and lucky. In Russian, <strong>счастливый</strong> is the same - both happy and lucky. </p>\n\n<p>Did people use to think that happiness meant good luck?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":278574,"title":"Is the verb &quot;swallow&quot; related to the noun?","body":"<p>I looked at the <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=swallow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> and it seemed unclear to me whether the bird's name comes from the action, or vice versa, or even if they are etymologically related.

The\n  etymological sense is disputed. Popularly regarded as harbingers of\n  summer; swallows building nests on or near a house is considered good\n  luck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>swallow (n.2)</strong> <br>\"an act of\n  swallowing,\" 1822, from swallow (v.).

Not having etymology references at hand, our lunchtime group settled on the theory that -dom in both these words was from \"dominion.\"  Dominion is ultimately derived from Latin <em>dominus</em> (lord of the house), if I understand my etymology correctly. It seems to make sense; free from domination is freedom, domination by a king is kingdom.  </p>\n\n<p>But it seems that this is not the case.  According to <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-dom\">Etymology Online</a>, this -dom is derived from Old English <em>dom</em> (judgement, law, statute) and is etymologically close to <em>doom</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm really confused by this origin.  It seems like the dom- prefix and the -dom suffix should be related.  Are they really not, or is it only that my references don't go back far enough or that my etymological understanding is superficial at best?
