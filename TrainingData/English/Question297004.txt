I do not want to know if nested flashbacks are okay. I am simply asking about tense. Thanks for the help! Question is below:</p>\n\n<p>Should a flashback be written in past tense? And if so, should the flashback occurring in it be in past tense as well or past perfect tense?</p>\n\n<p>Past perfect tense w/in present tense or Past tense w/in past tense or Past perfect tense w/in past tense Example below:</p>\n\n<p>(Flashback 1 in present)</p>\n\n<p>Samt takes hold of Judiada’s arms and says, “Ju . . .

Lāza’s still out there.” Walking in circles, Samt grabbed his sun-streaked, shoulder length hair in frustration and said, “He was here getting ready. Here. I just talked to him!” He stopped and looked at Judiada. “Doi minu teelio!” Three weeks ago!” Samt took a seat and remembered his last conversation with Lāza.</p>\n\n<p>Three weeks earlier . . .</p>\n\n<p>(Flashback 2 past perfect tense)</p>\n\n<p>Samt had grown tired of listening to the takeoff and landings of spacecrafts while standing in the control room.
