So here comes the question. It is possible to say both of those sentences, but I don't know why we can shift the \"that clause\". Does it work in the same way as \"heavy noun phrase shift\"? Or is it because this that clause is used as a noun being an object? </p>\n\n<p>Here is my assumption.</p>\n\n<p>3.\"I can say that the world will end.\"</p>\n\n<p>4.\"I can say with confidence.\"</p>\n\n<p>Both sentences work greatly without a that clause for the fourth sentence and without the prepositional phrase, \"with confidence,\" for the third sentence.
