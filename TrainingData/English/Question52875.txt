Is this universally agreed? </p>\n\n<p>The OED sense 2a of <strong><em>surgery</em></strong> explains its use to describe the room where a doctor sees his patients. The OED gives no indication that this sense is exclusively used in Britain.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2a. The room or office in a general practitioner's house or a health\n  centre where patients are seen and treatment is prescribed; the\n  regular session at which a doctor receives patients for consultation\n  in his surgery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nowadays where GPs work in group practices the individual rooms used by each are rarely, in my experience called surgeries. We refer to the entire building where our doctors practice as <em>the surgery</em>. \"<em>When you go to the village, could you call in at the surgery and collect my prescription</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>As we sit in our doctors' waiting room, when our turn arrives an electronic sign with the patient's name on says 'please go to room 5'. Hence the place where you encounter the doctor is not strictly a surgery, but nowadays a room within a surgery. It is historically known as a <em>consulting room</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As the OED explains, and as can be seen from the OED definition, <em>a surgery</em> is also a session during which the doctors are available to see patients. e.g. <em>morning surgery starts at 8.00am; afternoon surgery at 3.00pm</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The OED also goes on to explain how people such as Members of Parliament, Accountants etc hold <em>surgeries</em>, borrowing the word from the medical profession. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1846   Bentley's Misc. June 549   A small den [Dr. Faunce] called ‘the\n  surgery’.</p>\n  \n  <p>1862   M. E. Braddon Lady Audley's Secret III. vii. 200   The door of\n  the little surgery was ajar...

However, while reading a text about differences between British and American English I read the following lines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here's something else for Americans to be aware of: did you know that an <em>eraser</em> is called a <em>rubber</em> in Britain? A good British Mum makes sure her children go to school with a rubber in their pencil case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it's also not new to me that there are differences between British English and American English, but I was and still am surprised that that could somehow be misinterpreted.</p>\n\n<p>Checking the dictionary (<a href=\"http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/rubber\">OALD</a> and <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rubber?q=rubber\">OED</a>) I learned that <em>rubber</em> as <em>condom</em> is indeed an Americanism, though I can hardly believe that British people do not know/use that word.</p>\n\n<p>The other way round, I can imagine to some extent that Americans are not aware of the fact that it isn't that popularly known/used in British English.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, when talking to British people do I really have to expect that they don't know what I'm talking about when using the word <em>rubber</em> instead of <em>condom</em>?</p>\n\n<p>And when talking to American people, should I avoid <em>rubber</em> and use <em>eraser</em> instead whenever I expect it might sound ambiguous? To be more concrete: the OALD designates rubber (as eraser) as British English, thus do I have to suspect that an American may not be aware of that meaning?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when talking to both an American and a British at the same time, which words do I use for condom and eraser so that both will understand me correctly?</p>\n"},{"id":194569,"title":"Use of the expression &quot;Stop it!
