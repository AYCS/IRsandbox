From this latter term the name <a href=\"http://www.finedictionary.com/weevil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>weevil</em></a>, a small beetle, was probably derived. <em>Weave</em> was also the source for the Old English noun <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=web&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>webb</em></a> which meant \"woven fabric, woven work, tapestry\", whose meaning was later transformed to <em>web</em>, as in a <em>spider's</em> <strong><em>web</em></strong> (13th C) and <strong><em>cobweb</em></strong> (14th C).  </p>\n\n<p>From  the the related Middle Low German <em>wāfel</em> the term was loaned to Middle English (1377) and became <strong><em>wafer</em></strong>. The actual <em>woven-like</em> waffles that we eat today arrived in the US with the first Dutch settlers in 1620 on the Mayflower and were originally called <em>Dutch wafers</em>.

From <em>An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</em> (1808) by John Jamieson we gleam that since at least 1678, <em>waff</em> and <em>waif</em> meant \"the act of waving\" and \"to fluctuate\" whereas <em>waff</em> alone, denoted someone who was worthless. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>WAFF</strong> 3.
