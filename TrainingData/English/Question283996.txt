A newly invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically \"dead\" (e.g. <em>iron resolution</em>) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are: <em>Ring the changes on</em>, <em>take up the cudgel for</em>, <em>toe the line</em>, <em>ride roughshod over</em>, <em>stand shoulder to shoulder with</em>, <em>play into the hands of</em>, <em>no axe to grind</em>, <em>grist to the mill</em>, <em>fishing in troubled waters</em>, <em>on the order of the day</em>, <em>Achilles' heel</em>, <em>swan song</em>, <em>hotbed</em>. Many of these are used without knowledge of their meaning <strong>(what is a \"rift,\" for instance?)</strong>, and incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe I do know what a rift is, but I am unsure if I get his meaning here.
