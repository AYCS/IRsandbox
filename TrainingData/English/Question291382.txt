The true culprit eventually turned out to be a man living in a neighbouring flat, and who is now serving a life sentence for her murder.</p>\n\n<p>However the police first suspected Jeffries, because as the tabloids put it 'he was weird'. It is true he was a thoroughly eccentric man, buried in academia, with little knowledge of popular culture, and presenting awkwardly to anyone who was not a close friend. He was, nonetheless totally harmless.</p>\n\n<p>He eventually, quite justly, received a very large settlement for damages from the newspapers concerned and from the police.</p>\n\n<p>But my concern is over the use of the term <em>weird</em>. When, and why did it come to suggest something sexual? My dictionary defines 'weird' as <em>suggesting something supernatural; unearthly</em> - <em>very strange, bizarre</em>. It also defines <em>weirdo</em> as INFORMAL <em>a person whose dress or behaviour seems strange or eccentric</em>. These are the conventional meanings. But nowadays it tends to be used as code for sexual perversion. How did that happen? And how do we any longer say someone is weird without suggesting they are a paedophile? </p>\n\n<p>Link to the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/the-lost-honour-of-christopher-jefferies\" rel=\"nofollow\">TV film</a>.

(Which at least seems to prove that the word <em>weird</em> has the capacity to insult, otherwise why would they use it?)</p>\n\n<p>But the reason that it has engendered so much heat is entirely beyond my comprehension. It relates, after all, simply to the definition and modern usage of a word. </p>\n\n<p>Because of the storm of protest I will attempt more accurately to express what I think is happening here. I believe that some words, one of which is <em>weird</em>, (there are others like <em>strange</em>) if employed in certain contexts, can be used as powerful innuendo to suggest sexual perversion. And this is how they were employed by the tabloid media in 2010 against Christopher Jeffries.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that Jeffries did unusual things, such as giving himself a mild coloured hair rinse, led to him being labelled <em>strange</em>, and <em>weird</em>, by, among others, schoolchildren. Once these labels stuck they were picked up by the news media and made into far more. The fact that he carried these labels actually caused the police to arrest him for what they believed was a sexually-related murder. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Urban dictionary</em></strong> lists ten words which are closely related to <strong><em>weird</em></strong>. One of them is <strong><em>sex</em></strong> and another is <strong><em>gay</em></strong>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>But for anyone who remains in any doubt that at the level of tabloid newspapers such as <em>The Sun</em> that the word <em>weird</em> often carries sexual connotations should take a look at the following 13 letters on its <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/scottybryan/weird-letters-printed-on-the-suns-dear-deidre-page.\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Dear Deirdre</em> page</a></strong> - \n<strong>PERSONS LIKELY TO BE OFFENDED SHOULD BE WARNED THAT THIS CONTENT CONTAINS SEXUAL MATERIAL</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Do I need to make my case further?</strong></p>\n"},{"id":211929,"title":"what word class are the following words?","body":"<p>Ok, so I would like to know what word class numbers are and also time? for example twelve or seven o'clock? </p>\n"},{"id":205431,"title":"How to resolve the ambiguity of &quot;two day classes&quot;","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Two day classes will take place this week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, \"day classes\" is a compound.

Of course, there are circumstances when x > y and conversely when y > x. But, if you were told you had to fight your way through a number of zombies (and you didn't enjoy it and thus want to fight as few as possible), and you could choose to deal with x or y of them, x is probably going to be \"less\".</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, these words are \"subjective\". But despite their subjectiveness, there is a consensus on approximately how large they are. Can throng mean a trillion? Probably not it is usually used to describe a smaller number. Can throng mean zero? or one? No, it usually means a larger number. Well well. looks like despite the subjectiveness, there is an approximate region in which throng exists.</p>\n\n<p>We aren't going to get an exact, perfectly defined answer here. We may only get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pack, party  ≈ 30 ± 25\nrabble, throng ≈ 100 ± 60\nhorde, drove ≈ 10,000 ± 9,000\nswarm, plague ≈ a million or more\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the symbol used is the wiggly equals sign, which means approximately equals (although that might be subjective, its used with numbers so its in context). This hasn't defined a full order, it grouped them to give partial ordering. These numbers are just as an example. I am expecting someone to reason that e.g. horde and throng should be switched, or that drove is more like somewhere between 200 and 2000 etc.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you are very knowledgeable with english you may not be able to answer, I'm hoping that in the next year or two, someone will emerge who will cite numerous classical texts (for example) and explain that these words originate from there and are approximate equivalents to military groupings, e.g. roman soldiers who saw a legion's worth of barbarians would refer to it as (e.g.) a horde, as although it was the size of a legion it lacked the rank and discipline. Thus, please refrain from angrily stomping on this question as you do not have an answer, someone will. THIS question will become the approximate reference for poetic writers to approximate which word is most suitable to describe the scale of what they are writing of.</p>\n\n<p>There is no exact answer, but that does not mean that we have to surrender with: \"oh well if we can't get an exact answer better just put its subjective\".</p>\n\n<p>It is subjective, of course.\nGeorge Boole said \"All models are wrong, but some models are useful\". This is merely a guide, a rough model. Please, think of the writers trying to decide whether to describe 10,000 orcs as a horde or a rabble; do it for them, if not for me.</p>\n"},{"id":126141,"title":"Are derived class and deriving class interchangeable terms?","body":"<p>Consider the following statement that I quoted from <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228387%28v=vs.90%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inheritance and Derived Classes (C# vs Java)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can extend the functionality of an existing class by creating a\n  new class that derives from the existing class.
