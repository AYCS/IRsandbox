Currently I'm reading English Grammar in Use (2nd Edition Cambridge Press — Intermediate level). At page 14 here is what we can read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note the difference between <strong>gone (to)</strong> and <strong>been (to)</strong>:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Jim is away on holiday. He has <strong>gone to</strong> Spain. ( = <strong>he is there now or on his way there</strong>)</li>\n  <li>Jane is back home from holiday now. She has <strong>been to</strong> Italy. (= <strong>she has now come back from Italy</strong>)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I understand from the above example is that when we use <strong>gone to a location</strong> the person <strong>is still in that location or is heading there at the time of speaking.</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the contrary when we use <strong>been to a location</strong> the person <strong>is no more at that location at the time of speaking (now)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Then, at the next chapter there was the following exercise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Read the situations and write sentences as shown in the example:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Jack is driving a car but he's very nervous and not sure what to do.</p>\n  \n  <p>You ask: Have you driven a car before?</p>\n  \n  <p>He says: No this is the first time I've driven a car.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Maria is in London. She has just arrived and it's very new for her.</p>\n  \n  <p>You ask:  ..................................................</p>\n  \n  <p>She says: ..................................................</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is how I answered the 2nd Exercise.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You ask: Have you been in London before?</p>\n  \n  <p>She says: No this is the first time I've been in London</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason of my choice was the following: </p>\n\n<p><strong>gone to</strong> doesn't seem to be appropriate as it indicates just some movement/motion, a trip to London rather than a long/short stay in London. </p>\n\n<p>Also <strong>been to</strong> cannot work because if we use it that would mean that <strong>Maria is no more in London now</strong> and she has come back. I arrive at this conclusion based on the example in the grammar book that I provided above (Jane has come back from Italy)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore I thought using <strong>been in</strong> London would be the best choice.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I checked the answer at the end of the book, the suggested solution was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li><p>Maria is in London. She has just arrived and it's very new for her.</p>\n  \n  <p>You ask:  Have you <strong>been to</strong> London before?</p>\n  \n  <p>She says: No, this is the first time I've <strong>been to</strong> London</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really don't understand the choice of <strong>been to</strong> here. It has been specified explicitly at the beginning of the exercise: \"Maria is in London\". So if at the moment of speaking she is in London how it is possible to use <strong>been to</strong>. Wouldn't <strong>been in</strong> be more appropriate in this context? </p>\n\n<p>Could you kindly make some clarification on this?</p>\n"},{"id":84900,"title":"Present-Perfect: &quot;hadn&#39;t heard&quot; vs. &quot;haven&#39;t heard&quot;","body":"<p>Let's say I have just listened to a beautiful song wanted to immediately tell my friend about it.
