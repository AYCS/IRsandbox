[{"id":269626,"title":"Word for emotional state of jealous satisfaction from the whirlwind reaping of others","body":"<p>Consider observing someone <em>getting a taste of their own medicine</em>, <em>reaping the whirlwind</em> or whose <em>chickens are coming home to roost</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In some ignoble, jealous way such situations can be satisfying for observers, particularly if they were, themselves, hurt by the previous state of affairs. Is there a specific term for this hollow laugh of an emotion in an observer?</p>\n\n<p>There may well be a certain <em>cosmic irony</em> to the situation, it might even exemplify <em>vengeance</em>. It exemplifies <em>schadenfreude</em> and, as such, is a lot less noble than <em>the satisfaction of seeing justice done</em> but is, presumably, conveniently mistaken for it.</p>\n\n<p>But none of these seem to be on the button for what seems to be a very common emotional state. Many very precise words for other characteristic emotional states exist in various languages (<em>sehnsucht</em>, <em>hiraeth</em>, <em>schadenfreude</em>, <em>saudade</em>): a loan-word would also be interesting to hear, but this also gives me hope that such a word may exist in English.</p>\n\n<p>Words would be more interesting than phrases, but both will do. (It is, after all, idea easily expressed by description).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sample sentence</strong>: I watched aghast, disgusted and, I admit, with certain a certain sense of <strong><em>X</em></strong>, as the tyrant's great machine -- terror of Megalopolis -- turned, to pin its lifeless, limpid eye upon its own inventor.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":288928,"title":"What is the word or phrase that describes the feeling of well-being or satisfaction from an act (for example spring cleaning)","body":"<p>I am undergoing a rigorous \"spring cleaning\" exercise, where I am either donating to charity, selling on eBay or simply throwing away old possessions.</p>\n\n<p>Having cleared out an entire room that was filled with boxes it felt \"good\" / satisfying or perhaps gave me a sense of well-being that wasn't present before.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a word or phrase that describes this? other than \"feels good\" ?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"id":287509,"title":"A word that means &quot;being protected from other people&#39;s TMI&quot;","body":"<p>What I mean is the flip side to 'privacy'.\nIf having your own personal information protected from strangers' eyes is 'privacy', then being protected from unwanted exposure to strangers' secrets, intimate details, nude pics, etc., is...?</p>\n"},{"id":269370,"title":"To make amends from the other side","body":"<p>Suppose somebody has wronged me, and I want them to make amends.
