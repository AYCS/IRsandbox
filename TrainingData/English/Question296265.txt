So, he says to his friend:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hey, Person B! I've just been kicked out of my house and I have nowhere to go. I really have to figure out where to stay the next couple of days. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Person B understands that Person A is hoping that he would offer him to stay at his place. But he chooses to pretend not to understand, and, instead of saying sorry and explaining why Person A cannot stay at his place, person B says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There's a nice hotel near here, and it's not very expensive. I can give you the address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another example. Person B has secretly stolen the wallet of Person A. Person A has figured out that it was person B and when they meet, he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My wallet was stolen the other day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Person B says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Really? Oh, that's so unfortunate! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What idioms in English would one use to describe the behavior of Person B in the sample situations? I.e. pretending to be stupid or pretending not to understand something rather obvious, or pretending not to know something that you know; in other words, consciously imitating ignorance, indifference, or innocence.</p>\n\n<p>In Russian, the idiom is <em>to pretend to be a fire hose</em> (–ø—Ä–∏–∫–∏–¥—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —à–ª–∞–Ω–≥–æ–º) or <em>to pretend to be a boot</em> (–ø—Ä–∏–∫–∏–¥—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –≤–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∫–æ–º). The Armenian idiom is <em>to pretend to be a donkey</em> (’´÷Ä’•’∂ ’ß’∑’´ ’ø’•’≤ ’§’∂’•’¨). For me, these phrases are not quite unimaginative and cause a certain amount of amusement. I am hoping to find an English equivalent (or equivalents) that would be informal and/or sound funny(-ish), but that's not essential.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, I tried to look up the translation in the dictionary before asking, but to no avail, presumably because the phrases mentioned above are rather informal.</p>\n"},{"id":238179,"title":"A phrase to describe the idea of &#39;high literature&#39;?","body":"<p>We have terms like <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">'high culture'</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture#High_art\" rel=\"nofollow\">'high art'</a></strong>.
