[{"id":295961,"title":"Theoretical Phonemes","body":"<p>I have been looking at IPA recently and I was wondering if there are any sounds that can theoretically be created by humans but do not exist or have not existed in any known languages.

When I  began to learn English a bit more seriously two decades ago, I used a book that taught me to pronounce it shorter and more relaxed than the long sound of [u], the vowel sound in words like <em>pool</em>, <em>food</em>, and <em>cool</em>. It also told me to round my lips too.</p>\n\n<p>My pronunciation is fine (I hope, at least people around me seem to understand me perfectly), however I found a strange tendency in recent years, especially from Americans. (I can watch them on TV and video clips.) Many of them seem to not round their lips when pronouncing this [ʊ] sound.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I noticed this was the time I heard an ESL teacher pronounced it with the [ɯ] sound (she is not a native English speaker, by the way). There is no [ɯ] sound in English, but there is one in Thai language. The [ɯ] sound, though being a <strong>close-back</strong> vowel, is always unrounded. So it sounds very strange to me at first, since [ʊ] is a <strong>near-back-near-close</strong> vowel, and I thought it is supposed to be <strong>rounded</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Wonder why she pronounced it that way, I started to watch native speakers on TV closely, and found that only some of them pronounce [ʊ] unrounded in normal speech. Most of them seem to round their lips a little (how much the little is little is another matter). But when they exaggerate the word, most of them don't round their lips, e.g., I saw one judge on a vocal-focused reality show exclaimed <em>Good!</em> for maybe three seconds long, and in that entire three seconds <em>there was no lips rounding at all!</em></p>\n\n<p>I consulted <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-back_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>, and found that the matter of this rounding is unclear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Its vowel roundedness is generally rounded, which means that the lips are rounded to a greater or lesser degree, but is sometimes rather ambiguous. Because no language is known to contrast rounding with this place of articulation, the IPA has not created separate symbols to show this.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So which pronunciation is standard for the [ʊ] sound? Rounded or unrounded?</p>\n"},{"id":181114,"title":"Which does English “l” and “r” sound come under, an allophone or different phonemes?","body":"<p>I was very much embarrassed when I was pointed out by ELU Senpai that I made a great mistake by misspelling ‘Mod election’ as ‘Mod erection’ during ELU chat.</p>\n\n<p>We Japanese often make a silly mistake of mixing ‘l’ and ‘r’ characters and sound in writing and speaking, as we don’t have ‘r’ sound. We pronounce Lace and Race with the same sound “lehsu -レース.” </p>\n\n<p>I understand Chinese have distinction of l and r sound. Particularly Beijin locals are well-known for frequent use of r sound, which is known for the word, \"R化－R-lization\" in speaking.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve read that English l and r sound come under allophone (or phoneme.)</p>\n\n<p>Kenyusha’s Readers English Japanese Dictionary provides definitions of both ‘allophone” and “phoneme,” but both in scanty two lines. It reads as if both ‘allophone” and “phoneme” are akin, which I’m doubtful of vaguely.</p>\n\n<p>What is the difference of ‘allophone” from “phoneme,” and to which of them do English ‘l’ and ‘r’ sounds come under? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also We do not have θ and ð sound AndrewC has referred to in his comment. We cannot tell the difference between θ and ð, and pronounce both with s sound, e.g. “think” and “sink,” “thick” and “sick” in the same way. </p>\n\n<p>Until post WW II, most Japanese couldn’t pronounce v sound, though there was the letter ‘ヴ’ to express a 'foreign' v sound (only) in writing. We pronounce “Best” and “Vest” in the same B sound. But because of the influx of American culture and spread of English language, most Japanese come to distinguish b and v in speaking. We also pronounce “cofee” as “koh-hee.”</p>\n"},{"id":172119,"title":"&#39;Parasitic&#39; Phonemes","body":"<p>In searching for the reason for the mess<b>age</b> -> mess<b>enge</b>r shift, I came across the theory of the 'parasitic n.'
