[{"id":297282,"title":"assertion versus statement","body":"<p>This may seem like a stupid question from an English teacher (2nd year), but I am confounded.  What is the difference between writing an assertion to start a body paragraph versus writing a statement to begin a body paragraph?  My sophomores are working on their research papers and a colleague of mine said he keeps getting statements versus assertion sentences at the beginning of his students' paragraphs.  Is there truly a difference between the two?  I thought as long as the \"topic sentence\" mentioned a part of the premise/assertion from the thesis statement, the body paragraph was set up to argue and support that particular line of argument.  Am I just getting caught up in the minutiae or is there a literal difference.  I want to be clear and concise so my students learn from this experience and I don't want to confuse them or teach them something that is incorrect.  This is verbose, but I appreciate any and all advice.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":284289,"title":"I think I believe I feel statements should be introduced properly","body":"<p>In English, a subjective statement or a likewise question is often introduced by either of these phrases:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><em>I reckon [that] …</em> – <em>Do you reckon [that] …?</em> (dialectal)</li>\n  <li><em>I think [that] …</em> – <em>Do you think [that] …?</em></li>\n  <li><em>I believe [that] …</em> – <em>Do you believe [that] …?</em></li>\n  <li><em>I feel [that] …</em> – <em>Do you feel [that] …?</em></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first three have been dealt with in <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1070/are-there-any-differences-between-i-believe-vs-i-think-vs-i-reckon\">Are there any differences between &quot;I believe&quot; vs &quot;I think&quot; vs &quot;I reckon&quot;?</a> already, but <em>feel</em> hasn’t been covered as far as I can tell. To me, <em>I think</em> is the strongest statement about the validity of what follows, but <em>I believe</em> can imply at least as strong an endorsement.
