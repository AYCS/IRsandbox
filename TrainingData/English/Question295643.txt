They were crossing out words without long i, circling words with long i. One of the words was ink. I told them no, listen , we don't say i nk (say it with a long i to see what I mean ) and they crossed it out. Later , looking at the teacher's edition, it had ink circled. I thought it was just a mistake then I saw that an ink bottle was actually used as an example in the book for the  long i sound . I thought something was terribly wrong so I looked it up in the dictionary--it shows i in ink as a long i sound (I looked at many dictionaries, all were the same). This can't be right but I'm wondering if it's one if those things that's just been accepted and not questioned . Or if it's a category that hasn't been explored yet as needing a separate sound to clarify, like words with r-controlled vowels. Any comments on this would be extremely helpful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I realized I made a mistake with my original post and used long I all the way through. I meant to say that in ink, think, pink, thing, ring, king, etc ., in other words, words ending in nk and ng, the i is usually pronounced more like a long e sound, like e in meet. At least, that is how I have always pronounced it and heard it pronounced. I'm from California so this could be regional, but I've never heard it pronounced with a short i like in it.  Fumblefingers listed words in which a short i occurs, including ink, pink, bit, fit. I definitely hear short i in bit and fit , sounds the same. In ink and pink, i does not sound the same to me, nor have I heard people say it with the same i sound as in bit. Unless the i is getting so quickly blended into the ng that it is almost ignored, in which case it should have a special sound category like we teach r controlled vowels.  The pronunciation rules could be very different between the US and the UK .</p>\n"},{"id":222594,"title":"Why does this video say that /aɪ/ is to glide from /ɑ/ to /i/?","body":"<p>look at this video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjYVGAKQMdI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjYVGAKQMdI</a></p>\n\n<p>It said that to pronounce /aɪ/, we need to glide from /ɑ/ to /i/ </p>\n\n<p>/i/ long</p>\n\n<p>/ɪ/ short</p>\n\n<p>In the above video, they don't teach /a/ sound but only /ɑ/ sound</p>\n\n<p>Anything wrong with this video?</p>\n"},{"id":210002,"title":"The american R sound","body":"<p>After doing many research and find more than one result, I would like to know how exactly the R sound is pronounced in American English. </p>\n\n<p>On this video, the woman describes two ways.

When I  began to learn English a bit more seriously two decades ago, I used a book that taught me to pronounce it shorter and more relaxed than the long sound of [u], the vowel sound in words like <em>pool</em>, <em>food</em>, and <em>cool</em>. It also told me to round my lips too.</p>\n\n<p>My pronunciation is fine (I hope, at least people around me seem to understand me perfectly), however I found a strange tendency in recent years, especially from Americans. (I can watch them on TV and video clips.) Many of them seem to not round their lips when pronouncing this [ʊ] sound.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I noticed this was the time I heard an ESL teacher pronounced it with the [ɯ] sound (she is not a native English speaker, by the way). There is no [ɯ] sound in English, but there is one in Thai language. The [ɯ] sound, though being a <strong>close-back</strong> vowel, is always unrounded. So it sounds very strange to me at first, since [ʊ] is a <strong>near-back-near-close</strong> vowel, and I thought it is supposed to be <strong>rounded</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Wonder why she pronounced it that way, I started to watch native speakers on TV closely, and found that only some of them pronounce [ʊ] unrounded in normal speech. Most of them seem to round their lips a little (how much the little is little is another matter). But when they exaggerate the word, most of them don't round their lips, e.g., I saw one judge on a vocal-focused reality show exclaimed <em>Good!</em> for maybe three seconds long, and in that entire three seconds <em>there was no lips rounding at all!</em></p>\n\n<p>I consulted <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-back_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>, and found that the matter of this rounding is unclear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Its vowel roundedness is generally rounded, which means that the lips are rounded to a greater or lesser degree, but is sometimes rather ambiguous. Because no language is known to contrast rounding with this place of articulation, the IPA has not created separate symbols to show this.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So which pronunciation is standard for the [ʊ] sound? Rounded or unrounded?</p>\n"},{"id":186713,"title":"TH sound, is it continuant or stop?","body":"<p>How do you all pronounce the TH sound when speaking fast?</p>\n\n<p>For example, I've learned to pronounce the TH sound like a continuant sound, for example the hard one: ð.
