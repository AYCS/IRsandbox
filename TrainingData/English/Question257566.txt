Is the word <em>acorn</em> (the nut of an oak tree) in any way related to the Dutch word for squirrel, <em>eekhoorn</em>, the animal that collects acorns for food? </p>\n\n<p>Looking at <em>eekhoorn</em>, one will have a hard time finding any logical meaning to the naming of this animal. There's <em>eek</em>, which is not a Dutch word, and <em>hoorn</em> which means <em>horn</em>. So it doesn't make much sense.  But the pronunciation even in Dutch/Flemish is remarkably equal to the English <em>acorn</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Since many words have migrated country borders (like the NL <em>bolwerk</em> and EN <em>bulwark</em>), I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same with <em>acorn</em>/<em>eekhoorn</em>, except for the fact that <em>eekhoorn</em> is the actual animal that consumes the acorns. That would make it pretty unique, I think.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, <em>acorn</em> in Dutch is <em>eikel</em>, having different connotations which I won't explain here.</p>\n"},{"id":156880,"title":"What&#39;s the origin of the English infix?","body":"<p>A linguistics teacher of mine said in class that English is one of a small number of languages that uses infixes, that is, additions to the middle of words that alter the meaning.

The construction therefore, though in perfectly common use, is fundamentally an artful one and, as such, likely derives from a literary source or, if you will, first occasion of use by a writer of some repute. It may be that one or more Stack Exchange users has been exposed to the term in its original context.
