[{"id":263850,"title":"They are going to be letting me out next week","body":"<p>I am reading a book \"Second hand\" by Michael Zadoorian in which a boy visits his ex girlfriend in the hospital as she attempted suicide. There is a sentence which creates some difficulty to me: \"They are going to be letting me out next week\". I don't understand why the author used the verb to be in \"to be letting me out\". Is this correct?

And nothing for her to get all huffy about. Theresa looks at me and smiles, the one she was smiling before she forgot that she wasn't supposed to be smiling at me. \"Thanks, J.

I am an English teacher in Tokyo.  I mostly based it on Swan's <em>Practical English Usage</em>.  I would be grateful for any feedback to make it more clear.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, I did away with the distinction Swan makes between 'a listener' and 'a hearer' because it seemed needlessly complicated; I have changed that language to 'a speaker' or 'speakers'.  I think it is easier to understand this way, but please let me know if you agree. </p>\n\n<p>The other change I made to Swan in the 'advanced rules' section below was to encourage the usage of <em>come</em> more in #2 than in the other 2 contexts; to my ear, either <em>go</em> or <em>come</em> sounds natural in #1 and #3 (with the exception of occurrences after non-modal verbs in #3 - please see the next paragraph for that complication).  Do you agree?  </p>\n\n<p>I previewed this handout with a private student tonight and as a result of her questions and comments I refined #3 of the advanced guidelines to draw a distinction between modal and non-modal verbs.  This distinction seems correct, but adds a bit of a complicated wrinkle to the hand-out, because it does not seem to similarly apply to the #1 section of the advanced guidelines.  Any help on clarifying and simplifying this point would also be greatly welcome. </p>\n\n<p>(I had to spell-out the words ONE, TWO, etc. in the advanced guidelines section in order for them to display properly after originally having pasted from a Word document...)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>How to use the verbs come and go in English</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>It can be difficult for second-language students to use <em>go</em> and <em>come</em> correctly, especially in spoken English.  There are some simple rules you can learn which will enable you to correctly choose between these verbs 80% of the time, and some other more advanced choices you can make in other specific situations.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Basic Rules for Come and Go</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>come</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>We use <em>come</em> to describe movement to the place where one of the speakers is:</p>\n\n<p><em>Could you come here for a minute, please, Diane?\n~ I'm coming.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>We've come to ask you if we can borrow your car for a week.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I've got some people coming for a meal tonight. Can you and Henry come too?</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>go</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>We use <em>go</em> to describe movement away from the place where the speakers are:</p>\n\n<p><em>Are you going to the pub tonight?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Let's go and see Auntie Mary before the holiday is over.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>They've gone to live in Australia and I don't think they'll ever come back.</em>\n </p>\n\n<p><strong>More Advanced Guidelines for choosing between <em>come</em> and <em>go</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>ONE. <em>A speaker’s past or future location</em></p>\n\n<p>You can use <em>come</em> for a movement to a place where one of the speakers (a) already was or (b) will be at the time of the movement.  Choosing <em>go</em> in this context is also common.</p>\n\n<p>*Do you remember that I came/went to see you in Paris when you lived there?</p>\n\n<p>I will come/go to visit you in hospital when you have your operation next week.</p>\n\n<p>She can’t come/go to your barbecue party in Stanley Park on Saturday.*</p>\n\n<p>TWO. <em>Joining a previously-made plan</em></p>\n\n<p>We usually use <em>come</em> or <em>come with</em> to talk about joining a speaker’s previously-made plan, even if <em>go</em> is used for the movement itself.</p>\n\n<p><em>We’re going to see a movie tonight.  Would you like to come with us?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>We’re going to see a movie tonight.  Would you like to come?</em></p>\n\n<p>THREE. <em>Somebody else’s position</em></p>\n\n<p>When a conversation is about another person (who is not part of the conversation), we can use <em>come</em> for movements of other people who are also not speakers in the conversation to the place where that other person is, was, or will be.  Choosing <em>go</em> in this context is also common, <em>but only following a modal verb</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Mary is in Florida now, and she was disappointed that her husband couldn’t come/go with her.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Bill waited at the restaurant for an hour, but his girlfriend didn’t come.</em> [<em>go</em> would be incorrect here, because it does not follow a modal verb]</p>\n\n<p><em>She invited John to her birthday party next Saturday in Osaka, but John won’t be able to come.</em></p>\n"},{"id":100594,"title":"&quot;Decided to do X the next time she went for a walk&quot; vs. &quot;...the next time she goes for a walk&quot;","body":"<p>I came across this sentence in the book <em>Grammar Essentials for Dummies</em> which confused me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The lion with a thorn in her paw decided to wear sneakers the next time she <strong>went</strong> for a walk in the jungle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why is it <em>went</em> instead of <em>goes</em>?
