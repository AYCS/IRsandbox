For example, from the <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19871101&amp;id=eEBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DeoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2694,147934\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Gainesville [Florida] Sun</em></a> (November 1, 1987) [football game]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Headline:] Florida's offense couldn't get <strong>untracked</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From Bob Halloran, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=9YjDOBO31TUC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=%22couldn%27t+get+untracked%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wnqUpvOVzk&amp;sig=lyR8DCLohZOT3Qf6yIg4CJYgWmc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s25uVOPoCerziAK5s4DQCQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22couldn%27t%20get%20untracked%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Irish Thunder: The Hard Life and Times of Micky Ward</em></a> (2007) [boxing]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“He caught me with some good shots early that stunned me.

The MW coinage date of 1939 seems to apply to <em>untrack</em> in the specific sense of “escape from a slump,” since <em>untracked</em> as an adjective or adverb (as in “untracked wilderness” or “move untracked through the night”) appears to date back several centuries. </p></li>\n<li><p>In the specific sense of “cause to escape from a slump,” what is the logic of the expression \"get untracked\"? To my knowledge, <em>track</em> does not have as one of its meanings “to be in or to cause to be in a slump.” Is “get untracked” simply based on a mishearing of “get on track”?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is <em>untrack</em>, as defined in the <em>Eleventh Collegiate</em>, commonly used in any English-speaking countries outside the United States?</p></li>\n</ol>\n","related_questions":[{"id":114533,"title":"Origin of &quot;suit yourself&quot;","body":"<p>The young daughter of a friend of mine said, \"I think 'suit yourself' comes from a lazy tailor,\" which cracked us up.

Three explanations are given here, but they are not very convincing (I am not a native speaker). </p>\n\n<p>In one of our newspapers, someone gives an explanation. Apparently, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Duke of Wellington, the man who defeated Napoleon Bonaparte in the\n  Battle of Waterloo in 1815, though quite the ladies man, wasn’t really\n  much to look at. The most prominent feature of his not-so-handsome\n  face was his rather long nose. The officers and the men who served\n  beneath him began to affectionately refer to any nose which was\n  unusually long as ‘duke’. With the passage of time, this word began to\n  be used to refer to any nose; of whatever size. Since human fists are\n  notorious to be employed in fights to put a ‘duke’ out of joints,\n  fists began to be called ‘duke buster’. Soon, the word ‘buster’ was\n  dropped, and everyone started referring to fists as ‘dukes’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like a great story, but he did not cite any references.
