[{"id":296455,"title":"Definition of &#39;Gauntlet&#39;","body":"<p>I always thought gauntlet had 2 definitions: the hand piece of a suit of armour, and an obstacle course, like the kind filled with swinging traps and pits.</p>\n\n<p>I've looked on the internet for a definition that fits my second definition, but I can't find one anywhere. All I find is an armour glove and something where 2 rows of people attack someone walking down the middle as a form of punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone else know of this obstacle course definition I'm talking about? Can someone possibly link me to a definition if one is found?</p>\n\n<p>A few examples are from the first 40 seconds of this video: <a href=\"http://www.moddb.com/groups/adventure-time-community-group/videos/adventure-time-business-time\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.moddb.com/groups/adventure-time-community-group/videos/adventure-time-business-time</a></p>\n\n<p>And also I thought the game 'Gauntlet' was in reference to the fact that the whole game is like a gauntlet, as in an obstacle course with traps and such.</p>\n\n<p>Could someone confirm if this is a real definition or if I'm just losing my marbles?
