[{"id":295631,"title":"What does R. A. Lafferty mean by the word &quot;recension&quot;?","body":"<p>The following passages are from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._A._Lafferty\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. A. Lafferty</a>'s 1960 short story <a href=\"http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?69721\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Adam Had Three Brothers\"</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Willy McGilley, the oldest of the Wrecks (they now use Gentile names), has an old baked tablet made of straw and pressed sheep dung that is eight thousand years old and gives the true story of their origin. Adam had three brothers: Etienne, Yancy, and Rreq. Etienne and Yancy were bachelors. Rreq had a small family and all his issue have had small families; until now there are about two hundred of them in all, the most who have ever been in the world at one time. They have never intermarried with the children of Adam except once. And not being of the same <strong>recension</strong> they are not under the same curse to work for a living.<br>\n  <br>[. . . .]<br>\n  <br>They have been separated for many years. The three children were reared by their father under the <strong>recension</strong> and curse of Adam. One is a professor of mathematics, but I doubt if he can figure odds as rapidly as he could when he was one year old. The middle one is now a grand lady, but she has lost the facility of picking track winners in her dreams and much else that made her charming. And the oldest one is a senator from a state that I despise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I looked up the word \"recension\" in the online OED. The most relevant senses seem to be 2a \"The revision of a text (esp. a theological text); a particular form or version of a text resulting from such revision\" and 2b \"In extended use\". Indeed, some of the citations under 2b seem similar to the Lafferty quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1835   I. Taylor <em>Spiritual Despotism</em> ix. 388   We are the creatures of that recension of Christianity which happens to be current in our times.<br>\n  <br>\n  1859   I. Taylor <em>Logic in Theol.</em> 331   There is no new recension of the worship of the ancient Church.<br>\n  <br>\n  1909   <em>Burlington Mag.</em> Nov. 73/1   Dissatisfied with the effect, Cariani in his final recension attempts to concentrate the design by cutting down the canvas on the right.<br>\n  <br>\n  1952   F.

They were of better emotional balance, of greater diligence, of wider adaptability, of much vaster memory or accumulation and of readier judgment based on that memory.

The story was in the \"Household Tales\" of the Grimms' that appeared between 1812 and 1822. It was named Little Briar-Rose (Dorn-Roschen). Though written more than a hundred years after the Perrault story, Little Briar-Rose is of an earlier <strong>recension</strong>. Using the technique of diffusion and parallelism, the tireless Brothers Grimm, sometimes employing as many as one hundred oral versions of a story from all Europe and the Near East, were able to reconstruct and to date approximately (so they believed) the original stories. They set the date-of-origin of Little Briar-Rose (its most popular name), or Sleeping Beauty (its second most popular name) as being close to, but not before, the year 1000.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1457120\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Anamnesis\"</a> (1992):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"But they aren't creatures of Duffey, they're of another <strong>recension</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n","related_questions":[{"id":295799,"title":"What does word &quot;tanglefooted&quot; mean?","body":"<p>Context: </p>\n\n<p>\"I SUBMIT FOR your inspection one John H.

In the short term I will work\n  to ensure a smooth transition. After that I intend to spend time with\n  my extended family which is dispersed throughout the country and\n  hopefully get to some long deferred travel.
