I have a question regarding words that are created as a result of joining two words. Usually this happens when two technologies or methodologies are used to create something unique (I am particularly interested in fusion of two words based on abstract ideas or technology). The confusion I have currently is \"How to decide the proper word fusion?\"</p>\n\n<p>For example: Testbed vs test bed, feedforward vs feed forward vs feed-forward, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I have this confusion because certain authors use certain fusion words. I would like to know if there is a universal rule or any guidance when I have to combine two words indicating abstract concepts. </p>\n"},{"id":100246,"title":"Need a word that describes a biweekly publication","body":"<p>Our company publishes an internal e-newsletter that we call the &lt;Title&gt; Weekly. We're now going to publish every other week, so the title needs to be changed. The first solution that came to mind was &lt;Title&gt; Biweekly, but a few questions on this site have pointed out that \"biweekly\" is a troublesome word, and we didn't really like the word anyways.</p>\n\n<p>What is a good word to describe a publication that is now publishing less than it used to? Searching around on this site yielded \"fortnightly\" as an idea, but that doesn't fly as well across the pond. I just learned about the existence of \"hebdomadal\", but I doubt that \"bihebdomadal\" would get approved.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas? It doesn't even have to be a synonym of biweekly; in fact, it'd probably be better if we went in another direction. The publication is publishing less frequently so the idea of scaling back could be in play, but the new format opens the door for a more focused and relevant publication, because we won't be struggling for content week after week. So, a word like \"condensed\" could be on the table as well. Or, even a word that's better than \"regular\" to indicate that while it's not as frequent, it's still a regular publication.</p>\n"},{"id":79195,"title":"Best word for &quot;unable to change&quot;","body":"<p>I'm looking for a word that is the opposite of \"adaptable.\" I would like to say \"unadaptable,\"  but that's not a real word according to my dictionary. So, what's the best word out there for not-able-to-change?</p>\n\n<p><em>Update:</em> I'm embarrassed to admit I was accidentally searching the Mac's built-in <em>thesaurus</em>, not dictionary, when I checked to see if unadaptable was a word. My bad! I'll still award Jasper the answer for pointing out my obvious oversight.</p>\n\n<p><em>Update 2</em>:</p>\n\n<p>To respond to the various calls for clarification, I'm specifically using this word in a report talking about the development of certain kinds of subdivisions, especially very homogenous single-family subdivisions in outer ring suburban areas. In my report I'm referring to a neighborhood that can change at the micro-level, ie. it can improve or deteriorate, but it cannot change what it is: ie. the infrastructure pattern is not capable of supporting a different land use, and it is not economically feasible to retrofit the infrastructure, therefore the nature of the subdivision cannot be changed, while the condition of the subdivision (if it is deteriorating) may cause people to <em>wish</em> that it could be changed. </p>\n\n<p>So, with that in mind:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why not immutable?\" Immutable is a great word, but I understand it's connotation to mean \"permanent, unchanging\", in the sense that something simply is not subject to change, not that it might like to change but cannot. </p></li>\n<li><p>Why not \"inflexible?\" Inflexible connotes being \"unwilling\" to change, or perhaps being able to be changed (or reshaped / bent) but only slowly and with much resistance.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, in this situation I am looking for an adjective that describes an inability to adapt to changing market conditions by shifting from one land use to another. In this case I specifically use the word \"adaptable\" in many places to describe the opposite, and given the context I think \"unadaptable\" will be better understood than any of the other suggestions, even though I am aware of (and agree with) the comments about it's status as a rarely used and therefore imperfect choice.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for the feedback!</p>\n"},{"id":140535,"title":"A word to describe an empathetic employee in regards to their business","body":"<p>I'm a software developer and I'm looking for the correct business term that best describes an empathetic developer. More often than not, a developer is just a code monkey. They receive a set of business requirements and follow them to a T, regardless of whether the requirements make sense or not. However there are developers who take an empathetic approach to coding per business requirements. That is, the developer will analyze the requirements with respect to the business needs, the end user, design, and implementation, and then discuss potential issues with the business when they spot a requirement that doesn't make sense. One would think this type of mentality would be inherent in a developer, unfortunately it is not, so I'm searching for the best term that describes this. </p>\n\n<p>To me it seems like “empathetic” would be the best term but I have never heard this term used in a business setting.</p>\n"},{"id":161036,"title":"Word for Someone Who Watches Mountain Weather","body":"<p>I've been working on a paper regarding the Himalays.
