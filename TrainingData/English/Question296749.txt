[{"id":296749,"title":"greenwald (verb, transitive)","body":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Dawkins</a> recently informed twitter that the <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OED</a> has registered Glen Greenwald's last name as a transitive verb and assigned the following definition to it<sup>1</sup>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To misrepresent a more intelligent person's superior argument, typically on social media in the form of poorly written material under the guise of journalism. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is this: from what writing or writings of Greenwald's did his surname inherit this unfortunate registry into our lexicon?  </p>\n\n<p>Also, can someone provide an excerpt or a sample or article of someone greenwalding a more intelligent argument? </p>\n\n<p>My problem is the umbrella term of misrepresent which, or course, includes the semantics of malice and intention in this case, but I think could include the dangers of paraphrasing or simplification. Either way, I would like an excerpt or full length article of someone doing this. </p>\n\n<p>Also, dear readers, I would very much appreciate your feedback.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup><sub><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/682110072877547521\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/682110072877547521</a></sub></p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":202121,"title":"Historical Basis for &quot;To Graduate&quot; Being Only a Transitive Verb","body":"<p>About nine years ago, I received from a quite insistent source the claim that the verb \"to graduate\" is transitive, and, specifically, that the intransitive usage was <em>wrong</em>.  For example, the following are claimed to be correct:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The university graduates you.</li>\n  <li>You've been graduated!  [You have been graduated by . . .]</li>\n  <li>I graduated university X!</li>\n  <li>I graduated from university X!</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The last is interesting since it actually <em>doesn't</em> have an object; it has a prepositional phrase).  While e.g. the following are claimed to be incorrect:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>I graduated.</li>\n  <li>You won't graduate!</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has led to <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/66490/will-graduate-vs-will-be-graduated-vs-is-going-to-graduate\">this question</a>, which establishes that both uses are acceptable in modern usage, but that the intransitive usage was less common in the past.  Not <em>wrong</em>, mind you, just less common.</p>\n\n<p>Looking in dictionaries, it seems that <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/graduate?s=t\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dictionary.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/graduate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merriam-Webster</a>, <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/american-english/graduate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cambridge</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/graduate\" rel=\"nofollow\">TheFreeDictionary</a> indeed all support both usages as correct.  Something interesting happens with Oxford.  The <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/graduate\" rel=\"nofollow\">most complete definition</a> is on the sub-site for American English and lists intransitive as the primary definition with two different types of transitive usage as being \"informal\" and \"North American\".</p>\n\n<p>Under all this, I would like to ask a related question:  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there any merit to the claim that the intransitive usage of \"to graduate\" is <em>wrong</em>?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The claim specifically is that the intransitive usage is a modern invention (>1900), and that dictionaries have shifted to allow it.  Is this indeed the case?  Or, has the intransitive usage always been allowed but just was less common before now?</p>\n"},{"id":210405,"title":"Can a linking verb be transitive?","body":"<p>I found the following example on <a href=\"http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/feel_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com</a>.
