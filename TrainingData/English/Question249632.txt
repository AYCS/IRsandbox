I am <strong>not</strong> suggesting here, in <strong><em>this</em></strong> EL&amp;U question, that there is any such singular grammatical rule as indicated in the quote above.  The quote continues as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reduced sentence makes the disagreement between the subject's and complement's plurality obvious. What is one to do? Language is linear and we know \"The thing is X\" is better than \"The thing are X\", so we go with the former, which is the subject-verb agreement rule. But what is \"the books\" then? It must be thought of as a collective noun, even if it doesn't look or feel like one. Forcing something to be a collective noun is related to the idea of notional agreement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Others noted that <strong><em>grammatically defective</em></strong> is too strongly worded.  There is no such \"grammatical rule\" for subject/complement agreement.  Please help me understand/improve upon my line of thought here.  I'm stating that Sentence 2.1 presents a fundamental \"conflict\" or \"error\" (however one might define <em>error</em>) at some level (morphological, syntax, grammatical, semantic):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The thing is the books.

Some of the interesting comments below suggest that <em>yourself</em> here is an emphatic version of <em>you</em>. As RegEdit's answer points out, the example with <em>yourself</em> seems to be contrastive. The sentence with <em>you</em>, on the other hand, does not give the same reading. I wonder why that is? </p>\n\n<p>I note in passing that <em>yourself</em> seems to be an adjunct ('adverbial') here. This makes it different from another emphatic use of pronouns, which is when a pronoun appears as the subject of an imperative: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>You</em> do it! </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I originally gave the imperative example for two reasons. Firstly, the reflexive pronoun here is obviously not the object of the verb. Secondly, however, I gave it because there is no antecedent <em>word</em> in this sentence which could be the <em>subject</em> of the verb, or, which represents the same person as <em>yourself</em>. I am curious as to whether the rules requiring reflexive pronouns in emphatic usages, are basically the same ones that require us to use them the rest of the time. In other words, I return to my original question: Why is  a reflexive pronoun required in this case?</p>\n"},{"id":207829,"title":"When would you say &quot;I seen it.&quot;","body":"<p>I am not looking for explanations of why \"I seen it\" is wrong (though with sight there's an unfair grammatical burden that doesn't impact the other senses, whose past tense and past participle are the same - hear, heard, heard... feel, felt, felt... et cetera). </p>\n\n<p>I want to know from the snoots here: in which circumstances might you actually say \"I seen it.\"?</p>\n\n<p>By way of explanation: my work sometimes takes me to places, and to people, where and to whom \"I have seen it\" would stand out as strange.

Then come, follow me.” Mark 10:21 NIV</p>\n\n<p>The collocation \"give to the poor\" sounds a little strange for me.

No problem so far.</p>\n\n<p>I later became an English teacher myself (thank god, those days are gone :) and started being asked various questions, too. This wasn't a problem either - I answered them according to the books and sometimes added a little more of what I knew about \"real-life\" usage.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the more you learn about any language (including your own), the more you realize that there are certain truths written in books that are rather simplifications and generalizations - needed for the student to be able to learn things without being overwhelmed by too much information but not precise and exact facts.</p>\n\n<p>That wouldn't be a problem either. It's obvious that you can't discuss all details at the very beginning. But to my surprise (which still lasts), I also found out that there was actually no standardization authority that would have a final say in terms of what is right and what is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>And if you study English books carefully, you will realize that even Cambridge (as the main English testing authority in mainland Europe) and Oxford (as the unofficial language authority) often differ in their interpretations of what is correct and what is not. And American English (which I tend to use) doesn’t even seem to have these.</p>\n\n<p>I do understand that there are big differences not only among American, British, Australian, Canadian, South African... variations of the language but even among regions, classes etc. But someone from a country like mine would somewhat automatically expect that at least for each country there would be an \"ultimate authority\" which could say that I should use this or that if I want to speak/write correctly.</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of different dialects in the Czech Republic. Surprisingly many for such a small country. And that's perfectly fine. But if you're not sure what the standard, formal form is, there is the \"Dictionary of Standard Czech\" and the \"Rules of the Czech Language\" where you find the ultimate answer. And if you don't, there is the \"Institute for the Czech Language\" where you can get answers even to the most complicated questions. Germans have the same for their language (remember the argument over the sharp s not so long ago) and I believe so do most European countries.</p>\n\n<p>If you've read this far, you must be curious what my question actually is.

Does correctness really depend only on how often something is used?</p>\n\n<p>To pick just a few “ever green examples”, is \"better than I\" or \"better than me\" correct? Who’s the one to say that “color” is American while “colour” is British or Canadian? When my American friends say \"If I would've done that\", can they argue that it's correct just because it's used where they're from? Where can I find the line between “generally used” and “accepted as grammatically correct”?</p>\n\n<p>And an additional question: have there ever been attempts (that probably failed) to introduce a general English authority that would have the final say?</p>\n\n<p>I have absolutely nothing against colloquial, slang, spoken language. Actually, who doesn't use it and tries to be hypercorrect at any cost sounds like a moron. But there are moments when you want to consult someone you can trust. And no offense to this site (which I really love) but the answers often resemble rather personal opinions than definite facts. And therefore I'm asking this question to which there is probably no true, correct answer. But it was biting my brain for too long so it had to get out.</p>\n"}]}]
