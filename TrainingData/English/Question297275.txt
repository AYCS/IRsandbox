[{"id":297275,"title":"Broken moon and earth has stopped orbiting","body":"<p>I had a dream months ago, probably, last year. I tried many times in searching for answers in net but I couldn't find any article.\nIn my dream, I was inside the building and a part of the wall was destroyed so you can see the outside. The earth has stopped rotating in its orbit. When I gone outside, I looked up at the night sky. The moon was so bright, maybe, it's full moon. The creepy was the moon was broken and so close to the earth that appeared so big. I can see the cracks and big broken pieces.\nI hope that's not precognitive dream. It would be scary if ever it became true. Is there anybody can interpret my dream?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":268049,"title":"Enter or insert into the orbit?","body":"<p>There is a term <em>orbit insertion</em> which means a maneuver performed by a spacecraft flying by a celestial body in order to become an artificial satellite. </p>\n\n<p>What word or phrase would you use to describe the result of this process?
