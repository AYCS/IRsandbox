A novice programmer is a long term investment for a company – you’ll get more out of them than they get out of you for quite some time. <strong>One junior developer looks a lot like every other junior developer in terms of potential – except the one with the recruiter costs more money that only the recruiter gets.</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>From <a href=\"http://stablekernel.com/blog/the-stack-overflow-generation-a-guide-for-the-novice-programmer/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>A Guide for the Novice Programmer</em></a> (long post)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does the last bold font sentence mean about the developer?</p>\n\n<p>It'd be great if someone could tell how to split this sentence for easy understanding.</p>\n"},{"id":210487,"title":"&quot;The more, the merrier!&quot; -- Is this a sentence?
