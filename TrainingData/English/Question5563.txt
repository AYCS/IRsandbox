With those facts, I hypothesized to myself that perhaps the Danes influenced both languages, before they had diverged, some very long time ago.   Alas, that's all I can venture; though I know a fair bit about more modern influences on English &mdash; that is, Latin and Old French &mdash; I've haven't really seen this discussed before, which is no small wonder, as it seems that whatever influence the Danes had would have been ancient.  It's also pretty strange, as compared to French, because Denmark is a bit aways from England; it's doesn't just have a narrow channel to cross, nor, if I remember correctly, doesn't share as intimately connected royal and noble lines as the French have with England.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess my question is: Are the answerer's bolded words above correct?
