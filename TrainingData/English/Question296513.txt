After thinking about it for a minute, however, it seems like the use of either preposition may be valid, but that the sentence would mean different things depending on the choice. With \"between\", the sentence is referring to inter-group differences between the incomes of the rich and the middle class. With \"among\", the sentence is referring to intra-group differences in income among the individual members of each particular group.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly I have no idea if this interpretation is correct.
