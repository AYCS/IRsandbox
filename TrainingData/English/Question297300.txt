I'll try to paraphraze it: Parents don't think too much about teachers and in general don't conside too much of the educational system. In spite of it they disdain the teachers, but some they hate more and some the humiliate less. Am I right?\nI don't get the point of the sentence…</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":287531,"title":"What are the differences between &quot;being aware&quot; of something and &quot;being educated&quot; about something?","body":"<ol>\n<li>People are not aware about cleanliness.</li>\n<li>People are not educated about cleanliness.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do you think that both of the sentences stated above are correct?

So to use the conjunction word “as”, for me, is to reduce conscience to things it generates. Therefore I think the sentence is written loosely.
