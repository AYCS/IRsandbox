I noticed one post (<a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/188517/what-are-the-origins-of-hi-hey-hello\">what are the origins of hi, hey, hello?</a>) which is a step in the right direction, but doesn't quite answer my question.</p>\n\n<p>For my project, we want to compare and contrast greetings in different languages. For example, in English we may say, \"How are you?\" or, \"How do you do?\" when first greeting someone, whereas in Mandarin, it is common to say, \"Have you eaten?\" - \"吃了吗\" (google translate, hope it's right!)</p>\n\n<p>When I first heard this I was surprised, to say the least. I thought it an odd expression for when you first greet somebody. Likewise when my Chinese friends were learning English they said they found it difficult to answer the expression, \"How are you?\" and when they asked, I said I wasn't really sure either....</p>\n\n<p>When we are asked \"How are you\", we nearly never respond to the question with a genuine answer. In fact one of the only situations where it seems to make sense is deep in conversation or where pragmatics suggests something other than \"I'm fine.\" So, Why don't we say something a bit more concrete for greetings like, \"have you eaten?\" which has an answer that is a bit more tangible. To me it actually seems to make a bit more sense!</p>\n\n<p>So why is it that we say, \"how are you?\" and where does it come from? When did this greeting start to gain traction and what other greetings did it replace (if any)? How do you respond to this when asked?</p>\n"},{"id":265148,"title":"Is it correct if I ask &quot;Which anniversary is it?&quot; to know how long they are married for?","body":"<p>Is it correct if I ask \"Which anniversary is it?\" to know how long they are married for ?</p>\n"},{"id":212901,"title":"Is this a sarcastic answer to &quot;good to see you&quot;?","body":"<p>In the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119099/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fallen</a>, Denzel Washington's character, Det. Hobbes, is visiting a death-row inmate previously arrested by him. The inmate, Edgar Reese (played by Elias Koteas), greets him by saying \"It's good to see you, Hobbes\", and he answers with \"It's good to be seen by you, Reese\". I'm not a native speaker, but as far as I know, that's not a common answer, so I always understood that as sarcasm, as Hobbes saying that it was not good to see Reese at all, but answering in a way that sounds polite for someone who isn't paying a lot of attention.</p>\n\n<p>However, I just watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1gBn4645hg\" rel=\"nofollow\">an interview</a> with Denzel Washington where he does the exact same thing with the interviewer. He's greeted with \"Mr. Washington, it's great to see you\", and he answers with \"it's great to be seen by you\", and because it reminded me of the scene, it got me puzzled.</p>\n\n<p>So, is that a normal polite answer, and I'm seeing sarcasm in it because of the movie context? Is it actually sarcasm and Washington is being obnoxious, although there's no sign of that during the interview?

There, <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/22329/23633\">the answer by z7sg Ѫ</a> claims it is sometimes appropriate not to reciprocate when asked \"How are you?\". I guess the following situation would fall under the category of \"being asked by a shop assistant\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A little while ago I was visiting a US agency in a European country. There was an American man at a counter serving people. Each time a new person came in, the man would greet him/her with something like \"Hi, how are you?\" and a smile. Most people responded with just \"good\" or \"fine\". When my turn came, I responded with \"I'm fine, thank you. How are <em>you</em>?\". I could see the man was a bit surprised, but quickly recovered and replied he is doing fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When someone asks you \"How are you?\", he is probably not genuinely interested in how exactly are you doing. Why is it then <em>not</em> appropriate always to ask the same question back, or is it?
