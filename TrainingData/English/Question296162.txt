If the answer does exist and I have overlooked it, please let me know.</em></p>\n\n<p>So, I was under the assumption that the general rule for indirect question formation was to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>convert the question to a statement, </li>\n<li>convert the unknown part to the appropriate question word, and </li>\n<li>pull that question word to the beginning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unknown object:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What does wasabi taste like?</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>Wasabi tastes like [something].</strong> <em>(converted to statement)</em></li>\n  <li><strong>wasabi tastes like [what?]</strong> <em>(replaced unknown part with appropriate interrogative)</em></li>\n  <li><strong>[what] wasabi tastes like</strong> <em>(moved interrogative to beginning)</em></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Tell me <strong>what wasabi tastes like</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Unknown subject:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Who likes koalas?</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>[someone] likes koalas.</strong> <em>(converted to statement)</em></li>\n  <li><strong>[who] likes koalas</strong> <em>(replaced unknown part with appropriate interrogative)</em></li>\n  <li><strong>[who] likes koalas</strong> <em>(moved interrogative to beginning)</em></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Tell me <strong>who likes koalas</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the subject is what we want to know, as in the koala example, we still do the same thing - pull out the unknown, convert it to a question word, and move it to the front - except it is already in the front, so the last step is superfluous. The formula remains the same, however.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This works for pretty much any situation as long as the main verb is not <strong><em>be</em></strong>. That's where I get confused.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unknown... subject?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is his name?</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>His name is [Bob?]</strong>.</li>\n  <li><strong>His name is [what?]</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>[what] his name is</strong></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Tell me <strong>what his name is</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This, to me, is the correct indirect question. Thing is, because of the fact that <strong><em>be</em></strong> is all copulationary-wise an' all, we can often reverse the subject and complement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is his name?</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><strong>[Bob?] is his name.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>[what?] is his name</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>[what] is his name</strong></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Tell me <strong>what is his name</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now I know in speech this is probably quite common, but it sounds incorrect to me, and I would never write it. I believe (admittedly perhaps erroneously) that it is wrong. At least I think it is wrong*er* than the first example.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question: <strong>Is this 3-part rule I have been using wrong for <em>be</em> sentences?
