God, capitalized, is increasingly seen only at the start of a sentence. Leaving aside whether one believes in a god, or in the Christian God Himself, why is this convention not being criticized? </p>\n\n<p>God is after all a proper noun, the name of a deity which for over 2,000 years we have all heard of, and know by that very name. It matters not that <em>god</em> or <em>God</em> may or may not exist. It is a name. And like any other name that belongs to a real person or a fictional character in a book, it ought to be spelled with a capital letter. </p>\n\n<p>I always feel uncomfortable writing about God with a capital letter, I always feel there is a hoard of die-hard atheists ready to accuse me of being a creationist, god forbid. (Should that have been: \"..., God forbid\"?)</p>\n\n<p>Is the spelling of the Christian \"God\" politically incorrect?  Is God with a capital letter, grammatically speaking, an archaic tradition? And if so, why?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: From the answers so far posted, no one has yet mentioned the political and social consequences this deceptively innocent, lowercase spelling may have had on us, on today's society. And this has lead me wondering, whether in the history of the English language there has been anything similar; any linguistic <em>subversion</em>, spoken or written which was in reality a show of defiance toward an established authority such as a government or political leader.</p>\n"},{"id":114852,"title":"University&#39;s vs Universities&#39;, correct spelling of the possessive","body":"<p>Something belongs to the University. \nIs it the <em>Universities' logo</em> or the <em>University's logo</em>?
