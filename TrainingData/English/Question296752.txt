The format agreed upon is this: an audiovisual is projected on the screen, but is punctuated by live performances on the stage. For example, a sequence of a guy driving to work in rush hour is punctuated by a dimming of lights and while the AV fades out, real actors are seen driving on stage, seated in cutouts of cars, while the music changes tempo. The lights dim again and we see footage of the guy entering his office lobby- a 'tableau' of sorts, for want of a better/appropriate word.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there a word that describes this type of live-and-screened piece? I googled, and found the Japanese word <em>Rensageki</em>  and <em>New School Cinema.</em> I don't know about the Japanese word, but <em>New School Cinema</em> is far too generic/bland for me.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a single word to describe this better than \"Tableau\", which is what I've temporarily titled the script? Ideally, I'm looking for a single word. If none exists, a short and descriptive phrase, or a combo word like 'docudrama' will also do - as long as it is succinct/definitive. </p>\n"},{"id":282927,"title":"Is there a single word for &quot;sunflower seeds&quot;?","body":"<p>I assume in many languages there are single terms to refer to \"<strong>sunflower seeds</strong>\", so I want to know if there is such a word in English also.</p>\n\n<p>Example:\nTonight we should eat sunflower seeds while watching the movie.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I don't understand why this question is off-topic.
