Watson, et. al. I came across this paragraph in the discussion about discrete factors of inheritance in Mendelian genetics:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The character shown by a plant depends on the pair of factors it receives from its parents. If both factors it receives are the same, that is, two dominant (yellow seed) or two recessive (green seed), then the plant exhibits those traits - yellow seeds for the former and green seeds for the latter. If one factor is dominant and the other recessive, then the dominant character is expressed; in this case, a plant with a factor for yellow seed and one for green seed will show the dominant trait, yellow seed. But the factor for green seed persists, even if the plant is yellow, and can reappear unchanged in later generations. <strong>This was a signal advance.</strong> In the 19th century it was believed that the traits of parents were blended in their offspring and, once mixed, the contributing traits could not be recovered. At the time, this was a severe problem for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection. His critics pointed to that any favorable variation arising in an individual would have no long-term effect, because it would immediately be lost by blending.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had never come across the phrase <em>signal advance</em> before and wasn't sure of its meaning based on its context in this paragraph. </p>\n\n<p>The context was difficult to ascertain, as the first part of the paragraph referred to a genetics concept, where <strong>signal</strong> could be a noun and <strong>advance</strong> could be a verb, but the second part of the paragraph discussed the hypothesis and how it provided evidence to change the thinking of the day.</p>\n\n<p>However, after reading the question in the comments, I am beginning to think that <strong>signal</strong> was possibly being used as an adjective and <strong>advance</strong> was the noun that it modified.</p>\n\n<p>I looked for the definition of <strong>signal</strong> when used as an adjective, and this definition may be applicable:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>unusual; notable; outstanding: <em>a signal exploit.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If that is the case, then the sentence likely means <em>this was notable progress.</em></p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate any feedback, especially if someone has come across this usage in scientific writing.</p>\n"},{"id":283112,"title":"adverb phrases modifying each other","body":"<p>Here comes  a very stupid question. I always wondered what type of grammatical phenomenon allows adverb phrases to be placed right next to each other repeatedly. So something like this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I ate a bag of popcorn [at 8'o clock] [in a movie theater] [to get rid\n  of my hunger]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All the bracketed phrases are adverb phrases, and it seems to me that all of them modify verb \"ate\". Now here is the stupid part. Is the reason they are able to come right next to each other without any thing that actually connects them (for example, conjunction) because those adverb phrases modify the one that comes right next to them? I know for sure adverb phrases can modify other adverb phrases, just like how adverbs are able to modify other adverbs. </p>\n\n<p>So \"at 8'o clock\" modifies \"in a movie theater\" and \"in a movie theater\" modifies \"to get rid of my hunger\". But all of them also modify verb \"ate\" at the same time.
