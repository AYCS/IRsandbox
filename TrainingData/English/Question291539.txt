He noticed that collection notices were sent largely to neighborhoods with a minority population.  Knowing that collections are traded like sub-prime mortgages, and that there is likely no inherent racism in this, he was nevertheless able to find a common thread:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Non-minority/white populations who were more connected to friends and family were more able to help with surprise expenses such as car issues, funeral expenses, and accidents.  On the other hand, minority populations would struggle to withstand those momentary hardships even if they exhausted the resources of their peer network;</p>\n  \n  <p>The cumulative economic penalties (late fees, interest rates, etc) create a system where the oppressed stay oppressed, and the financially endowed stay endowed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not mentioned in this broadcast were the wealthy risk takers, who collectively make bad decisions that could see them end up in a similar situation where they are unable to borrow from friends. </p>\n\n<p>I intend to create a chart, that shows this \"economic plasticity\" among groups of people.   Any better term is appreciated</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>In a world where <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial inequality</a> is the leading topic of these times, I think this term would be useful in gaining perspective, and perhaps, compassion for those who suffer from this plight</em></p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":255966,"title":"What is the sound of teeth hitting each other in cold weather called?","body":"<p>What is the sound of teeth called that occurs in chilly weather: the sound that comes due to teeth crashing in each other in an extremely chilly winter.</p>\n"},{"id":239116,"title":"What term would best describe a need for friendship?","body":"<p>A friend of mine asked an interesting question today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If sexual frustration is need for sex and romantic frustration is need for romance, what is need for friendship?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note: To be clear, this is saying Sexual Frustration is the want/need for sex, and Romantic frustration is the want/need for romance, not that they are the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>And I can't come up with a good answer for that.  \"Loneliness\" was suggested, but that's not quite specific to needing a friend, so much as needing anybody at all.  And \"socially frustrated\" doesn't quite work either, because it implies being in a larger social group when that is not necessarily desired.</p>\n\n<p>So, what term would better describe badly needing a friend?  </p>\n"},{"id":238789,"title":"A term to describe a phrase that can be changed without having to know the origin","body":"<p>I'm sure I read about this on this website, but I am clueless as to what it was.

There are fresh Oreos, and then there are two different ways they can go stale: dry/hard (in low humidity) and soft/mushy (in high humidity). To me, the dry/hard stale and the soft/mushy stale are opposites of each other, but they are also opposites of fresh as well.</p>\n\n<p>Now to give another example is apathy. The opposite of apathy is to feel strongly. Which could be both love and hate, which are both opposites of each other. I could love stale Oreos, I could hate stale Oreos, or I could feel completely apathetic about stale Oreos. All three of these seem to be mutually opposite of the other.</p>\n\n<p>But also think of something too with things like sexism and racism and other political correctness where it's possible to go so over-corrective that it becomes its own offensive antithesis to both PC and non-PC alike. (I can't really think of a way to lighten this one with Oreos...)</p>\n\n<p>I found the term <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autoantonym\" rel=\"nofollow\">autoantonym</a> which seems to help a little bit with the relationship. I also know that in art and design you would call it a color triad where three colors are as far from each other on the spectrum as possible. However this still seems to come up short in trying to solve my existential Oreo issue...</p>\n\n<p>*EDIT Ah! So let me add one last element to the question. In each instance where I think this situation could apply, I think we go from two words, A and B which appear to be binary opposites. It can either be A or not A. <em>But</em> when you add word/concept C which is both not A and not B, you either have a natural transition where it's possible to smoothly take the conversation to a broader or narrower scope (like emotions with love, hate and apathy). <em>OR</em> you could have a more unnatural transition where there isn't a clearly defined word for C (as far as I can tell there really isn't a word for that humid kind of stale. And that sad state of affairs really should have its own word, right?). And at the end of all this, it seems like we're trying to find a Word C even now... </p>\n"},{"id":101515,"title":"Word to describe things that run after each other","body":"<p>Is there a word to describe tasks that need to \"run one after the other\"?
