Even so, we can consider that Barbadian English was born at that time, even though a language changes and receives influences all the time.  Among those that are neither vulnerable nor endangered, and considering the time when the first settlers arrived, what variety of English has been in the Americas longer than any other?  In other words, where was it that the English Language first arrived in the Americas and is still spoken in 2014 in a way that allows us to call it a variety of English?

To my Boomer-generation ear, it says the respondent somehow feels that s/he is doing me a favor by setting things right rather than accepting responsibility for them, and somehow cannot see that a problem truly is involved.
