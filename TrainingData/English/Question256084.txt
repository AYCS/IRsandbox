It is getting very heated.</p>\n\n<p>Now, someone has posted a picture of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_Grand_Duchess_of_Luxembourg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charlotte</a>, Grand Duchess of\nLuxembourg, with the word 'Asylum Seeker' written under it, which caused a lot of debatte. One point which keeps returning is \"she wasn't seeking asylum, she was in exile\", the other one being \"That's why we have to censor the web\" (<em>shudder</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Before making my own comment, I researched the meaning of both words but came to the conclusion that both can be used for 'political refugees' (Oxford Dictionary).</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: What is the difference between Asylum and Exile? Bonus: In context of 'political refugee'.</p>\n\n<h3>EDIT 1</h3>\n\n<p>An example: A dictator/monarch/bloke with his own opinion is hunted and has to flee. He wasn't catched but fleed by his own terms. By my own understanding, he fled and asked asylum in another country. However, if he were indeed catched, he would be sent into exile (since he was explicitly sent somewhere else by the opposing party). If that is true, why is it that the word \"asylum\" is not used with certain people?</p>\n\n<p>In my case, it is Charlotte. She clearly fled from the nazi regime on her own terms (she could have stayed) and yet, Wikipedia states \"During the German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II, Charlotte, exiled in London, became an important symbol of national unity.\".</p>\n\n<p>Also, exile means that someone is not allowed to return. However, someone who lives in asylum cannot return either because he might get killed. I hope this helps illustrating my troubles distinguishing both words.</p>\n"},{"id":50843,"title":"What is the difference between optimal and optimum?","body":"<p>My question is exactly as the title says.
