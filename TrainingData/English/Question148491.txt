Although this is in a software/IT environment, I'm specifically looking for a non-technical, visual description.</p>\n\n<p>\"Walled garden\" is very nearly the best description, but looking at wikipedia's definition (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform</a>), the software does not restrict access to data inside our \"walled garden\", rather, it encourages access.</p>\n\n<p>The concept I'm attempting to describe is more about loss of control over the data: the software receives new information, processes it in various ways, then \"releases\" it into a \"space\" where the data is readily accessible to anyone. However, once the data is in that \"space\", we are unable (more precisely, un-willing) to make any kind of change to that data; it \"roams free\".
