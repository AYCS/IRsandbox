He tries\n  to help them organize their thoughts by condensing, reducing —\n  learning what not to include.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I imagine “the stage of typed-out paralysis” to be the stage of your typing-out fingers being frozen and your writing work stalled. I’m confortable with ‘typed-out fingers / hands,' or 'typed-out messages/ essays,' but I was hung up on the expression, ‘typed-up paralysis.’ Whether it's phisical or mental, can ‘paralysis' be 'typed-out' by hands phisically as the logic?</p>\n\n<p>McMillan English Dictionary defines “type out” as:\nto write the whole of something using a keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘type’ as:\nwrite (something) on a typewriter or computer by pressing the keys, with an example ‘He typed out the second draft.’</p>\n\n<p>Cambridge English Dictionary defines “type out” as:\nto use a computer or a typewriter, to make a copy of something in writing.</p>\n\n<p>None of these definitions seems to give me a hint to make out what is exactly meant by “typed-out paralysis,” and again the question, can ‘paralysis’ be typed-out?</p>\n"},{"id":29763,"title":"What does &quot;on its way out&quot; mean?","body":"<p>What does this phrase mean?
