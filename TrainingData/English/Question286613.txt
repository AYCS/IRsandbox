But if we look at the first image, although it is clearly \"one toast\" that phrase is considered ungrammatical. Instead in English we say and write: “one piece of toast” or “a slice of toast”. The second image shows \"two toasts\", but we say “<em>two pieces (or slices) of toast</em>”. </p>\n\n<p>Oxford Dictionaries provide this example:   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>My breakfast is always the same: <strong>two pieces of brown toast</strong> with slices of banana on top, a cup of tea and an apple juice.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that although <em>apple juice</em> is generally considered uncountable, in this instance  it's not. That's because we think of <strong>an apple juice</strong> being contained in a glass, cup, box or carton; and containers are countable. However, if we were to spill the apple juice on the surface of a table, we might say: “Oh! I've spilt <em>some</em> apple juice” And finally, we call the food <em>toast</em>, and not ‘two toasted/browned pieces of bread’.</p>\n\n<p>My question is very simple.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why is <em>toast</em> uncountable?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bonus: The song <a href=\"http://www.bbcamerica.com/mind-the-gap/2013/06/06/the-cultural-divide-brits-vs-americans-on-toast/\"><em>Toast</em></a> sung (spoken) by the British pop band, Streetband, in 1978.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":286897,"title":"How unusual is toast?","body":"<p>Is there any food, other than 'toast' (i.e. slices of bread browned by fire, electric heat, etc.) that, even when it is in domestic-sized, countable amounts is nevertheless treated as an uncountable, mass noun.</p>\n\n<p>This question arises from the discussion here <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/q/286613/103961\">Why is “toast” uncountable?</a></p>\n"},{"id":253507,"title":"Is &quot;functionality&quot; a mass noun in certain contexts?

I thought it was weird because those two words should conjure up breakfast food and not \"spineless\". So I used my Google-Fu to determine what exactly it was.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out <strong>milk toast</strong>, which is what my ears were hearing, is actually <strong>Milquetoast</strong>, a character from a comic strip in the 1930's. The name of the character was so popular, it was made into a word and used in the English language. Definition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Milquetoast (<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/milquetoast\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>)</p>\n  \n  <p>milque·toast  [milk-tohst] </p>\n  \n  <p>noun ( sometimes initial capital letter )</p>\n  \n  <p>a very timid, unassertive, spineless person, especially one who is easily dominated or intimidated: a milquetoast who's afraid to ask for a raise.</p>\n  \n  <p>Origin: \n  1935–40,  Americanism; after Caspar Milquetoast,  a character in The Timid Soul,  comic strip by H. T. Webster (1885–1952), American cartoonist</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The character, Caspar Milquetoast, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Milquetoast\" rel=\"nofollow\">was apparently named after milk toast because it was bland and unassuming</a>.</p>\n\n<p>People tend to say or write this term as milktoast or milk toast. Buuuuuuuut the only one that has the definition similar to milquetoast is milktoast, as seen here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Milktoast (<a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/milktoast\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>)</p>\n  \n  <p>milk-toast  [milk-tohst]</p>\n  \n  <p>adjective</p>\n  \n  <p>1.easily dominated; extremely mild; ineffectual; namby-pamby; wishy-washy.</p>\n  \n  <p>noun\n  2. milquetoast.</p>\n  \n  <p>Origin: 1815–25</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I'm having difficulty with the origin of the word. Milquetoast made the usage popularized and basically created the term... but somehow milktoast came earlier than milquetoast?</p>\n\n<p>Both of these definitions came from dictionary.com, so I thought it was just a mistake. But I can't find any other good references to milktoast's origin outside of urban dictionary, which isn't helping me with this current problem. So I'm not sure if this really is a mistake or if milktoast is just... not a word.</p>\n\n<p>In looking up milktoast, I found <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/milk%20toast\" rel=\"nofollow\">milk-toast</a>. Since it's hyphenated, I thought it must be a compound but... I can't find a single other use of milk-toast outside of dictionary.com. I don't even know it it's a word. And again, I can't find anything that tells me about it's origin.</p>\n\n<p>So what I want to know is...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are milktoast/milk-toast actually words? Are they just improper spellings of milquetoast?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Also, if they are words, do they predate milquetoast? Do they mean the same thing as milquetoast?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is writing the term as milk toast wrong? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I almost always see milquetoast written not in the French form \"milquetoast\" but the English form \"milk toast\". Technically, writing \"milk toast\" in place of \"milquetoast\" is wrong because they don't mean the same thing, but people seem to do that because they hear it as \"milk toast\". And the word milquetoast is technically derived from milk toast. So I don't know if the use of milk toast in place of milquetoast is wrong.</p>\n"},{"id":182270,"title":"Why do The Sopranos leave off the last vowel in Italian words?","body":"<p>For example, they pronounce \"ricotta\" as \"rih-gaht\", \"manicotti\" as \"mani-gaht\", and \"prosciutto\" as \"pro-shoot\".</p>\n\n<p>I googled this, and according to <a href=\"http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/418951\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post from Chow.com</a>, this is a common thing around New York and New Jersey, particularly in Italian-American restaurants.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a cultural thing, or something related to the history of how the English language adopted these words, or what?</p>\n"},{"id":169367,"title":"When do you use the plural form for nouns that are generally considered uncountable?","body":"<p>When should the plural form of the nouns <em>combustible</em>, <em>material</em> and <em>liquid</em> be used?</p>\n"},{"id":157032,"title":"Why is &quot;charge&quot; uncountable?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>He shall give his angels <strong>charge</strong> over thee, to keep thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why is <em>charge</em> uncountable here?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God gave Joshua a <strong>charge</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, it is countable.</p>\n\n<p>I can't find authoritative sources.</p>\n"},{"id":147360,"title":"Why do more sentences start with &#39;data&#39; as a plural, than when it is within the sentence?","body":"<p>I recently put together some Google n-grams for a short piece on the transition of the word <strong>data</strong> into a singular (mass) noun: <a href=\"https://medium.com/data-visualization-and-analysis/356332cdb81\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data are Beautiful: Data's story in grammar</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There was one peculiar finding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When starting a sentence, the trend reverses. \"The data are\" and \"Data are\" are approximately twice as common as \"The data is\" and \"Data is\".
