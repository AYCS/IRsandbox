T. Taylor · <em>Hardwich's Manual Photogr. Chemistry</em></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In recent decades, the terms <em>squeegee bandit, squeegeekid, squeegee thug</em> emerged as these urban tribes began to pester motorists at busy road junctions. <em>OED</em>'s earliest citation is from 1985 (<em>Washington Post</em>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When rush-hour traffic backs up along the downtown streets here, the ‘squeegee kids’ are in business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What is the etymology of <em>squeegee</em>? <em>OED</em> says that the noun <em>squeegee</em> is from the verb <em>squeege</em>; and <em>squeege</em> is the strengthened form of <em>squeeze</em>. What does \"strenghtened form\" mean here? Why a single letter alteration from <em>z</em> to <em>g</em>?</p></li>\n<li><p><em>OED</em> compares <em>squeegee</em> to <em>squilgee</em> and says \"of obscure origin\" for the etymology of squilgee.

Can they be malapropisms? I couldn't find anything about <em>squimjim</em> though.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: <em>Squeegee</em> is a nautical word originally and later used in photography, then window-washing. <em><a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=squeegee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Etymonline</a></em> doesn't add much to what I have found already.</p>\n","related_questions":[]}]
