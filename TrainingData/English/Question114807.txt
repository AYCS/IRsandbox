I'm all in favor of Anglicizing when it comes to foreign names in English (so much so that I'll take Byron's GWAD-al Quiver over the sorry-sounding gwah-thahl-kee-VEER any day); and, yes, I pronounce Beaumarchais the way Straker does in the play. Apparently Shaw the Irishman (and Tanner the Britisher) deem this incorrect. And so my question is: what would they (Shaw and Tanner) accept as correct in this case?

The owner of the gallery, Paul (who has a mild southern accent, similar to Matthew McConaughey), pronounced it the same way during several shots of him filmed after the auction, and numerous other times during the episode. In fact, in one scene, Paul pronounced it like that in front of a musical-instrument expert who was called in to appraise it, but the expert did not correct him (I note that the expert did not say the word at all throughout the segment, possibly to avoid embarrassing Paul on television).</p>\n\n<p>Two of the bidders also pronounced it like that as did the owner again.</p>\n\n<p>I particularly noted the pronunciation because this show was the third time this week that I heard it pronounced this way.

(“I’m <em>walkeen</em> to school,” or “Why are you <em>runneen</em> so quickly?”). Unlike the <em>in’</em> pronunciation, <em>een</em> does not appear, to my observations, to be dependent on either region or class, nor even generation. It doesn’t get caricaturized in song lyrics or on greeting cards. It doesn't even seem to run in families! When I’ve mentioned this pronunciation to other people, many haven’t even noticed it (“She says <em>runneen</em>? I never noticed before.”) </p>\n\n<p>I don’t <em>think</em> I have heard a Brit pronounce it. But I have certainly heard Canadians and Americans from various ages, social classes and regions pronounce this <em>een</em> ending consistently.
