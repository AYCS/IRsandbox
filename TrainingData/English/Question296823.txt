For example, let's say that someone has asked for my thoughts on restaurants A and B. If I said that A was good for a, b, and c, and B was good because of d, e, and f, then let the person asking make their own decision. Is there even a name for this?

I only remember looking up the definition, which was something like \"existing in this world as opposed to an imagined one.\" This makes it somewhat synonymous with \"real,\" \"actual,\" or \"factual,\" but it's not any word that commonly appears in thesauri (or anywhere for that matter), so don't expect to find it in your average thesaurus. I've already looked through several. I believe it was a Latinate word, however.
