First, let me make this clear that I do not have any specific, credible information that can back up my own theory. </p>\n\n<p>But I think that, as this \"as little as 1 day\" is an adjective phrase that has to compare 1 day with some other period of time, a noun should be present before \"as little as 1 day\" in this form.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can get your money back in <em>some period of time</em> as little as 1\n  day!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, it doesn't sound brilliant but seems to convey the meaning. </p>\n\n<p>I know that not putting noun before the adjective phrase \"as little as 1 day\" is fine, but it feels strange, when I think logically, to perceive an adjective phrase as the object of a preposition (in this case, in). </p>\n\n<p>So, what type of grammar rule or anything of sort licenses this?</p>\n"},{"id":283819,"title":"Preposition after conclude","body":"<p>If the police conclude that the person died by accident, should I say 'The police concluded in an accident' ?</p>\n\n<p>To me, this sounds like they finish the story by having an accident.</p>\n"},{"id":223607,"title":"(allegedly) ungrammatical preposition stranding","body":"<p>Certain types of preposition-stranding are considered by some linguists to be \"ungrammatical\" in English, even though they do not seem remotely strange to me (an English speaker).

In each case, the language would be more natural in modern English with the word \"that\" left out.  And there doesn't seem to be any way to make common sense of the usage of \"that\" (such as an article or object).  It seems to be an actual part of the preposition.</p>\n\n<p>What is specifically interesting to me is that in learning Spanish, I noticed that prepositions \"before\" and \"after\" are almost always followed by the word \"de\", which can have a similar meaning to the word \"that\".  So in Spanish you would say \"despu√©s de ...\" or \"antes de ....\" followed by the phrase.  So these older phrases betray a common pattern that has been lost in English.</p>\n\n<p>Am I correctly interpreting the word \"that\" as part of the preposition, or is there some other way to dissect these sentences that I'm missing?
