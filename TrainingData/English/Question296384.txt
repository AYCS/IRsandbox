This advice was disapproved by someone else in the discussion and said that it's not useful, \"all you have to do is hammer a socket on it and pop it off, not hard to do.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to visualize how this works. What is a socket, how does it look like? All I know of a socket is the ones on a wall that you put a plug into in order to connect electrical equipment. Another relevant definition I found is \"a device intended to hold an electric light bulb mechanically and connect it electrically to circuit wires.\" I'm not sure what this is, but I don't think it's what he's describing. </p>\n\n<p>So you hammer this <em>socket</em> on the locking lugs, by the way, after looking it up I realized that the person may have misunderstood about locking lugs and I think he meant <em>locking lug nuts</em>, which is a fastener used to secure a wheel on a vehicle that requires a special wrench to remove it. So you <em>pop off</em> this lug nut after you hammered a <em>socket</em> on it. <em>Pop</em> I checked means \"to suddenly break open or come away from something often with a short, loud noise\". So I'm assuming this involves some kind of tool as well in order to <em>pop</em> it off? How does this work, what am I visualizing?
