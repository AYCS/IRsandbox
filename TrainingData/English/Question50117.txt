Strangely enough in the Old English alphabet there were similar letters such as æsc or ash, and œthel or ethel. Is there a connection between the classical ligatures and the Old English ones? If so, why do we use Old English names and not Latin ones? And if not how rare is such a coincidence? Bonus question: It seems from the comments and answers so far that the only times we use ligatures are in reference to classical works but the only names we have for ligatures are Old English or Runic names.

Bring them out to us, that we may <em>know</em> them.\"   </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>6</strong> Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him,</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>7</strong> and said, \"I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>8</strong> \"Behold, I have two daughters who have not <em>known</em> any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.\"   </p>\n  \n  <p><sub>This story is used Biblically to illustrate why Sodom was truly a wicked city and deserved to be destroyed: Despite Lot's offering his daughters to the evil men of Sodom to fulfill their rape fantasies, they opt instead for 1) homosexual relations, 2) to assault Lot's favored guests and 3) to assault God-sent angels (albeit, in disguise.) </sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I look things up on the <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=know\">Online Etymology Dictionary</a>, it says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Anglo-Saxons used two distinct words for this, <em>witan</em> (see wit) and <em>cnawan</em>. <strong>Meaning \"to have sexual intercourse with\" is attested from c.1200, from the O.T.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OK, cool.  So it seems to be telling us that those first English translators of the Hebrew Old Testament were the ones who first adopted this new meaning of <em>to know</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>But my question is: Why did they choose <em>know</em> in the first place?  What made this seem like a good word to translate to?  Did it have a closely related sense in Old English that made it easy to slightly shift its meaning? (\"To intimately know\", perhaps?)  Or was it that they were so puritanical about writing vulgar thoughts in a Holy Book that they consciously chose <em>know</em> as a euphemism so as not to distract readers from their communion with God's Word?

And why do (H, K, Q, R, W, sometimes Z) have less orthodox names?  (Is \"ar\" for \"R\" a corruption of \"ehr\", perhaps?) \"J\" needs to be different, so as not to be confused with \"G\".
