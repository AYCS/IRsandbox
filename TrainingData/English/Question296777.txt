This is an expression that is used to describe a short visit in someone's dooryard (driveway) that often means not staying long enough to even get out of the car.  It is the opposite of what could be called  <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/30170/8360\">conversational dieseling</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I have used it all my life, and only recently learned that it is native to Maine (my home state), and pretty much no one else has ever heard of it. I find this peculiar. </p>\n\n<p>My first thought was that <em>dooryard</em> was a hold over from our English roots, but the <a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dooryard\">Free Dictionary</a> indicates that it is \"US and Canadian\" usage. (I suppose if you overlap the US and Canada, you get Maine.) Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dooryard\">Urban Dictionary</a> describes is usage as limited to Aroostook County, the northernmost part of Maine along the Quebec border.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dooryard\">Merriam-Webster</a> puts its first recorded use around 1764 and draws the parallel with barnyard and backyard, and describes it as the yard in front of the door of the house. I believe that nowadays, Mainers would tell you it means the same thing as driveway, which makes sense given that the driveway usually runs beside the kitchen door of the houses here, which would be the entrance for informal guests.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone tell me more about the history of this word, and does anyone know about the actual extent of its usage?

I was looking for a word that could never be used to describe two things as both being the most important. I think some of these words, like 'imperative,' express necessity as opposed to importance, but I may be wrong. The word 'key' expresses importance, but it, like 'important,' could be used to refer to multiple things. The two most important players are Sam and Ashley. The two key players are Sam and Ashley. I was thinking of a word that would describe importance as 'best' describes 'goodness,' but I'm realizing that that doesn't really make sense because even the word 'best,' though I think it tends to often describe only one thing, is often used to describe two things. The two best players are Sam and Ashley.</p>\n\n<p>I guess, with the superlative, if you take any adjective and put the noun it's modifying in a singular form, it implies that that noun is the single strongest possessor of that adjective. I could just say \"The important thing to do is to stay calm,\" and I think that would imply that that is the single most important thing to do because the word 'thing' is singular.</p>\n\n<p>I think the fact that the same word can be used to describe the single strongest possessor of a trait (the tallest person) and multiple strongest possessors of a trait (one of the tallest people) kind of rubs me wrong. If anyone's curious, I was thinking of inventing the word 'monobest' or 'unibest' to mean single best. This way, you couldn't say \"one of the monobest\" because 'mono' means one, and something can't be both both multiple and one. Similarly, 'monotant' or 'unitant' could mean single most important (I've shortened the word 'important'). </p>\n\n<p>Thank you all, and sorry if this question was misleading.</p>\n"},{"id":132299,"title":"What is the word for &quot;history of the study of the subject&quot;?","body":"<p>Suppose the subject is nutrition.
