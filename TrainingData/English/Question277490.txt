[{"id":277490,"title":"Stochastic antonym, medical context","body":"<p>I'm looking for a word that compliments stochastic (randomly determined) in a medical context, specifically in describing when radiation effects occur.

In more advanced speak, it's where a programme can be used without it affecting the system registry in any way.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, the portable application (an EXE file), along with all the supporting files necessary for the programme to properly run¹, is stored in a single folder (downloadable as a zip file). In this respect, it's considered <em>portable</em> because it's <strong>self-contained</strong>, and as such can be used on any computer the folder is located on.</p>\n\n<p>In comparison, most programmes that people use are actually <strong>installed</strong> on the specific computer itself, so that the system registry is changed, and the EXE—along with all the necessary supporting files—is stored in the \"Program Files\" director(y)(ies)² in your main hard drive (usually <code>C:/</code> but can be any other drive you choose). In this way, it's not considered \"portable\" because it's tied to that specific computer. </p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h3>Now, the question...</h3>\n\n<p>I want to know if there is an antonym in computing jargon for <em>portable</em>. In other words, I'd like to know if there's a word out there that means \"non-portable\" in the sense described above. (Other than <em>non-portable</em>. Obviously. Also, I'm aware \"installed\" is an appropriate candidate. I'd like to know if there is another term not so <em>ad hoc</em>-y.)</p>\n\n<p>It can be either common or rare, but must be actually in use (i.e., not made up on the spot here at EL&amp;U). If there is no word, that's fine; just tell me. I don't want a made-up word; I want a word that's actually used, even if only a little bit. </p>\n\n<p><strong>(Note: I said <em>word</em> here, not <em>term</em>, so it'd have to be an adjective that can be used in the format <code>[~~~] application</code>, in clear opposition to the format <code>[portable] application</code>, which is a very common phrase used to refer to portable programmes.)</strong></p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>¹ DLLs, PNG/JPG/BMPs, INIs, etc.</p>\n\n<p>² In Windows, it's usually (if not always) either <code>Program Files</code> or <code>Program Files (x86)</code>, depending on whether you install the 64-bit or 32-bit version of said programme, respectively.</p>\n"},{"id":266927,"title":"Antonym for &quot;Praise&quot;?","body":"<p>I'm looking for an antonym for \"Praise\".
