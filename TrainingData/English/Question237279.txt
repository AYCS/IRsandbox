[{"id":237279,"title":"use of suffix and agglutination","body":"<p>Sir,\n    I am an assistant teacher of English in a higher secondary school in a remote village of Basirhat - ii block. In my school the first summative evaluation is going on where in the English grammar question of class - vi it is asked to form the antonym of the word, 'Hope', by using suffix to it. The concerned grammar teacher of class vi argues that the answer is 'hopelessness' without considering the fact that the word, 'hopelessness' is the derivative of the word, 'hopeless' and not the direct derivative of the word, 'hope'. My question is : does the question exist at all where it is asked to form the antonym of the word, 'hope', by using suffix?\n        Perhaps, it is a silly question but I am expecting your valuable opinion on it out of my responsibility to my pupils. Please reply. Thanking you.\n                                                                              Faithfully yours,\n                                                                                Supriyo Roy\n                                                                         Basirhat - ii, North -24 - pgs,\n                                                                         West Bengal, India</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":248538,"title":"Is it correct to use the suffix -ian when referring to names?","body":"<p>Oftentimes when reading academic texts I will come across the suffix \"-ian\" as a way to denote ownership.

I intuitively feel like that's OK for this particular word, where it isn't OK for a noun like \"book\". </p>\n\n<p>The second question from ELL is about the lack of an article in front of \"implementation\" in this sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tusk said the EU would go ahead anyway with new sanctions against 19 Russian and Ukrainian individuals and nine entities next week, despite having agreed on Monday <strong>to suspend implementation</strong> for a week to boost the chances of success of the Minsk talks.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Intuitively, I think it's fine to say either \"suspend the implementation\" or \"suspend implementation\", but again, I'm unsure of my grammatical footing here. </p>\n\n<p>In the second question, the asker thought that if you could substitute a related gerund form into the sentence and it still made sense grammatically, the original word might follow some special set of grammar rules. It seems to me that the Latin suffix <em>‑ion</em> (denoting action or condition) is the key feature of these words.</p>\n\n<p>Do these words that can be both an action and a state or condition actually have special treatment grammatically, or has common usage made some grammatically incorrect usages seem OK? </p>\n"},{"id":234538,"title":"Does the spelling of &quot;brainy&quot; change when suffix is added?","body":"<p>Which is the correct form, \"brainyency\" or \"brainiency\" - when the suffix \"ency\", which describes the condition of being \"brainy\" is added?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"}]}]
