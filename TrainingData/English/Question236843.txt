Also, why is it OK to use both forms? It seemed to me that when there is \"noun+to phrase\" structure, this to phrase is linked to the subject. For example:</p>\n\n<p>We didn't have anything to wear. (Who had nothing to wear? Us!)</p>\n\n<p>But unlike this example sentence, the to phrase in sentence 1 implies that I or we are the people who should not fear her,  which means that it's not modifying its subject \"her\", but other nouns that are not even in the sentence. The sentence itself makes perfect sense to me, but I don't know why it is. Can someone please explain why it is grammatically fine to use sentence 1 and the difference in meaning between those two sentences?</p>\n"},{"id":273800,"title":"Noun as modifier—singular or plural?","body":"<p>Which one is correct?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>statistical models for process monitoring</p></li>\n<li><p>Statistical models for processes monitoring. </p></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":263130,"title":"&quot;I wish for a rest now&quot;: what does &quot;now&quot; modify?","body":"<p>Consider this sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am truly amazed by my success at this diagramming business, but I wish for a rest <strong>now</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think that the adverb \"now\" modifies \"rest\".
