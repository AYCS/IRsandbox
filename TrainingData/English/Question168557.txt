I'm including an example sentence for the sake of showing how the word can be used but this is not the only situation that <em>amae</em> can be observed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a romantic relationship, the woman will mostly feel _______ for the man who supports her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Amae</em> (甘え) is a word from Japanese; and it obviously has a cultural and historical significance in Japan (which is the usual case) but the concept is not unknown to Western cultures. It is often mentioned as untranslatable but here is an explanation from <em><a href=\"http://www.kirainet.com/english/amae-%E7%94%98%E3%81%88/\" rel=\"nofollow\">kirainet.com</a></em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Amae</strong> (甘え) is a Japanese concept/word that is used to describe people’s behavior <strong>when you desire to be loved</strong>, you desire someone to take care of you, when you want unconsciously to be <strong>depending</strong> on another person (your parents, your wife/husband or even your boss) with a certain meaning of <strong>submission</strong>. For example, a person with lots of <em>amae</em> would be the one who is capricious so he/she gets the attention from other people, children are the best example of <em>amae</em> behavior, always aiming for pamper from their parents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are extensive studies on this concept and there are translations of this word considered as not a good equivalent. Japanese psychiatrist, Takeo Doi, claims that there isn't any equivalent of this term and it is unique to Japanese culture; but the following excerpt is from an article that compares <em>amae</em> in Japan and United States.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Doi defined Amae as the ability “to depend and presume upon\n  another’s love or bask in another’s indulgence” (1992, p. 8) and\n  called Amae “a key concept for the understanding not only of the\n  psychological makeup of the individual Japanese but of the structure of Japanese society as a whole” (1973, p. 28). </p>\n  \n  <p>Although Amae\n  is a common word in the Japanese language, it has no exact\n  equivalent in English. Some translations are <strong>“whining,” “sulking,”\n  “coaxing,” “pouting,” “wheedling,” “being spoiled or pampered”</strong>\n  (Johnson, 1993) and <strong>“cherishment”</strong> (Young-Bruehl &amp; Bethelard,\n  2000), but none of these translations fully conveys the meaning of\n  the complex phenomenon of Amae. For one thing, almost all of\n  these terms have negative connotations in English, but Amae does\n  not ordinarily elicit disapproval in Japan.</p>\n  \n  <p>Doi took the lack of an\n  English translation of the word Amae and the complexity of the\n  concept as evidence that Amae is unique and central to Japanese\n  culture, but he provided no empirical data to support this claim.\n  The lack of English translation and the difficulty in defining the\n  concept may be an indication that Amae is more salient and more\n  frequently experienced in Japan, but they do not rule out the\n  possibility that it\n  exists\n  in non-Japanese cultures.</p>\n  \n  <p><sub><em>Amae in Japan and the United States: An Exploration of\n  a “Culturally Unique” Emotion</em> by Yu Niiya and Phoebe C.

Thus, trust can be the basis of the <em>amae</em> relation but not the concept itself. <em>Amae</em> satisfies the subconscious desire for unconditional acceptance in a positive way but it is doesn't indicate <em>submission</em> alone.</sub></p>\n"},{"id":252186,"title":"English equivalent of two popular Chinese slangs: 学霸 (academic overlord) and 学婊 (academic bitch)","body":"<p>In popular Chinese language, especially in Internet Chinese language, we use the word \"学霸\" (literally meaning \"academic overlord\") to refer to someone who does very well in his/her study and who always achieve high grades in exams.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we use another word \"学婊\" (literally meaning \"academic bitch\") when we (jokingly, without any malicious meaning) speak of someone who does excellently in his/her study but who likes hiding it from the others, which is their most important difference from \"学霸\" : for example, if you ask a \"学婊\" about how he/she feels about the last exam he/she will most probably tell you \"Oh it was too hard for me. I really messed it up, and I must get an F this time!\" while in fact he/she performed excellently, perhaps much better than most of the others in that exam.</p>\n\n<p>So are there English equivalents for these two Chinese Internet slangs? As far as I know, in U.S. the word \"<a href=\"http://www.echineselearning.com/blog/xueba-curve-wrecker-at-school\" rel=\"nofollow\">curve-wrecker</a>\" might take similar meaning to \"学霸\", and I'm wondering if there is any other alternative word. But for an English counterpart to \"学婊\", I simply have no idea.\n<br>\n<hr>\n<strong>EDIT</strong> I think maybe I need to clarify more about the word \"学婊\". First it is not equivalent to \"modesty\", although \"modesty\" can sometimes explain a \"学婊\"'s behavior. I think maybe the word <em>\"sandbagger\"</em> in @Avangion's answer in the meaning \"downplay or misrepresent one's ability\" is by now the closest word, although it might take too much derogatory tinge.<br><br>\nGenerally \"学婊\" is a teasing/joking word and is rarely used as an insult. And the motivations why a \"学婊\" downplays his ability or mispresents performance may be:<br><br>\n1). He/she knows that this exam was super-hard and most people do feel bad about it. So when asked about how he/she feels about it, he/she will not tell them the truth that he/she did quite well, so as not to hurt other people's feelings.<br><br>\n2). Out of modesty. And this part may have been hardwired into Chinese cultural genes from ancient times -- showing off is almost always despiced in Chinese cultural context ,and modesty regarded as a significant virtue.<br><br>\n3). To deceive his/her peer components by downplaying. This is not the usual case, but can happen.\n<br>\n<hr>\n<strong>EDIT AGAIN</strong> According to JanusBahsJacquet's comment (I failed to find the link), the Wikipedia definition describes it as <strong>someone who “pretends not to cram before an exam, then breaks down in hysterics after and gets comforted by everyone, only to appear top of the class when the results are shown”</strong>, which I think is a pretty typical and accurate description.</p>\n"},{"id":232049,"title":"Word or phrase for doing something poorly so that someone else does it for you?","body":"<p>Let's say that I abhor doing a particular chore such as the dishes.
