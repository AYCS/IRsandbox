Or do not. There is no try.</em></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But what I'm more interested about is how it is <strong>perceived</strong> by a native English speaker. For example, the unusual word order makes the sentence <em>more poetical</em> in Russian and some other languages. It does not make the sentence harder to understand nor does it make it sound incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that English is quite different in that regard. There is usually only one correct word order. On the other hand, there exist things like alliteration which have zero effect on native Russian speakers, even if their proficiency in English is good.</p>\n\n<p>Which labels would you attach to Yoda-speak? Is it easy to digest? Does it sound incorrect? Poetical?

Subject + Verb--I am running.<br>\n  2nd. Subject + Verb + Subject Complement--I feel good.<br>\n  3rd. Subject + Verb + Object--I made a pie. <br>\n  4th. Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object--I got him a present <br>\n  5th. Subject + Verb + Object + Object Complement--I helped him hide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>,and that sentences, which do not fit in any of these types seemingly, have their elements reduced or inverted. For example, an imperative sentence \"Stop\" is actually \"You, stop;\" as for interrogative sentences, they are regarded as are having their subject and verb inverted. Students are highly recommended--or arguably forced--to memorize these types in order that they be better at understanding structures of sentences.</p>\n\n<p>I heard that countries using this kind of method are only Korea and Japan. So I've got some questions: Does any of you have any clue about how this method has become adopted? I mean, was there any scholar who insisted this?

My interest is in simple technical writing where it is most important that the reader be able to parse the sentence grammatically.
