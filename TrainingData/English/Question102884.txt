[{"id":102884,"title":"Is the use of the word “terrible” in a positive sense at all common?","body":"<p>I recently had an argument with one gentleman where he charged that he had heard the word <em>terrible</em> being used in a positive sense, as if something was good, or great. I had lived in the States for over 12 years where I was exposed to different strata of society from PhDs to lowly construction workers and warehouse serfs one of whom I was as well. I have heard people talk of all sorts of <em>bad</em>, <em>brutal</em>, <em>sick</em>, even <em>ill</em>, and generally <em>awesome</em> things, but I had never encountered the word <em>terrible</em> being used that way, even in this age of ironic hipsters.</p>\n\n<p>In the question <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/22837/origins-of-the-word-terrible\">about the origins of the word</a>, few people pointed out that in French the word <em>terrible</em> does have a positive colloquial meaning, which is confirmed by several dictionaries. Likewise, English dictionaries acknowledge different meanings for the sister word <em>terrific</em> pointing that the meaning of <em>fantastic</em> and the like is informal, and the meaning of <em>inspiring terror</em> is archaic. But no respectable dictionary I had checked does mention any sort of ambiguity in regards of <em>terrible</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The only source known to me as yet that acknowledges the positive sense of <em>terrible</em> is Urban Dictionary, and even there it has been <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=terrible\">consistently downvoted</a>. Yet, it still received some votes, so at least some people think there is a legitimacy to this claim. Is there anything to this at all? Is that some sort of new phenomenon, or is it utterly misguided? If it is indeed real, are there any examples of such usage in popular culture?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":4812,"title":"Is the word &quot;wotcher&quot; British slang?
