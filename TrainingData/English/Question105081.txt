(<em>edit</em>- It has come to my attention that 'via' was once a 'wee-ah' from Latin, but I don't feel like this helps my question. If anything, that just makes me wonder why there is that variation in the beginning 'ē' and 'ī'.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I'm guessing the difference between 'uh' and 'ah' may just be regional, but that doesn't explain the <strong>first part</strong> of such a teeny word. </p>\n\n<p>This has been driving me nuts for awhile. <strong>I've tried online dictionaries</strong>, asking English teachers, and they all are the reason (as well as TV and movies) for why <strong>I'm still clueless</strong>.
