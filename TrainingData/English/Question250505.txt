I want to know if people agree or can point out the flaw in my thinking.</p>\n\n<p>I've been attempting to wrangle some pronouns into a constructed language I've been making. In the process of doing so, I've done a lot of research, especially on the English language. For a long time, \"it\" (the personal pronoun, not the dummy pronoun) has been bothering me, and now I think I know why.</p>\n\n<p>One of the tricks I've developed for determining the fine differences in meaning between nouns is to attempt to replace them with something else to see if the meaning has changed. For conjunctions, I move around the clauses of a sentence in order to figure out the exact mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>It didn't occur to me to attempt this trick with \"it\" until recently. And when I tried it, I got some interesting results:</p>\n\n<p>1) \"Where's my book?\"\n\"It's on the table.\"</p>\n\n<p>2) \"Isn't my kitty precious?\"\n\"I think it's evil, but whatever.\"</p>\n\n<p>3) \"This Rubik's Cube is driving me crazy!\"\n<em>sigh</em> \"Give it to me.\"</p>\n\n<p>I spent such a long time trying to figure out a noun phrase that worked as a replacement. Originally, I tried to use demonstratives (for reasons that will become clear), but they never sounded right.</p>\n\n<p>Then I figured out this:</p>\n\n<p>\"The thing's on the table.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I think the thing's evil, but whatever.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>sigh</em> \"Give the thing to me.\"</p>\n\n<p>Note: \"that\" (demonstrative pronoun) would not have worked; in cases 1 and 2, that would have sounded wrong. \"that thing\" might have worked for 2, but it sounds even worse for 1.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not saying that it's a perfect fit; \"the thing\" may not quite sound right in some circumstances, but it's meaning seems to be remarkably close to \"it\". I can't think of any examples where it would sound downright wrong. Furthermore, the fact that it sounds awkward in some situations to English speaker's ears may have more to do with the ready-and-waiting \"it\"; why phrase things so that it takes longer?</p>\n\n<p>This is interesting because if using the definite article together with \"thing\" is a stronger replacement for \"it\" than using \"that\", then a similar trick should work with he/she, right? \"the person\" perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>Not so:</p>\n\n<p>A) \"Who is he?\"\n\"He's the President.\"</p>\n\n<p>B) \"Shh! The boss is coming this way.\"\n\"Ugh, he's such a jerk.\"</p>\n\n<p>C) \"Mom says you're grounded.\"\n\"Why does she have to ruin everything?\"</p>\n\n<p>D) \"Annie wants us to go to Six Flags.\"\n\"She got us tickets? Sweet!\"</p>\n\n<p>When I was experimenting with ways to replace he/she, I first hit upon \"that person\".</p>\n\n<p>\"that person\" works well for A and B:</p>\n\n<p>\"Who is that person?\"\n\"That person is the president.\"\n\"Ugh, that person's such a jerk.\"</p>\n\n<p>But it only barely works for C or D (if at all). I instinctively know why; family and friends seem too close in the social deixis for \"that person\" to work. People who you know seem to be barred from the use of \"that person\" in the discourse.</p>\n\n<p>\"that\" has even less of a success rate; it only seems to fit with A:</p>\n\n<p>\"Who is that?\"\n\"That's the president.\"</p>\n\n<p>Both \"this\" and \"that\", when used to refer to people (this is my father, these are my friends, that's Annie by the bunch bowl, etc...) seem to work best when used in questions or introductions. Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>\"the person\" flat out does not work at all. The definite article is simply too vague, for some reason.</p>\n\n<p>So, to recap: \"the thing\" seems to work reasonably well as a replacement for \"it\", and sometimes demonstratives work better, but the other third person pronouns seem to require at least a demonstrative in its replacement, if it can be replaced at all (the referent may be too close for it to work right). Using the definite article just doesn't work.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an explanation for this?

I'd like to improve my English structure (in speaking and reading) while reading the Bible. I've invested many hours to better understand the different translation approaches from over 30 existing Bible translations. I prefer reading in Bible translations which uses a \"moderate dynamic equivalence\" (see: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>). </p>\n\n<p>I wondered if my order of Bible translations with nearly 100% standard English is more or less correct.

E.g. the Bible passage \"The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak\" (Mark 14:38b) is from a grammatical point of view perfect but the words \"spirit\" and \"flesh\" are not often used in \"standard English\". So the definition of \"church English\" is the English language whose grammar and syntax is perfect but uses a lot of old words and structures as e.g. the KJV (King James Version) does?</p>\n\n<p>I noticed in three Bible passages differences in the language but I was not able to figure out which sentence is not perfect english grammar. The structures which sounds a little strange to me are highlighted.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Mark 10:21</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A) Jesus looked closely at the man. He liked him and said, “There's one thing you still need to do. Go and sell everything you own. <strong>Give the money to</strong> the poor, and you will have riches in heaven. Then come with me.” Mark 10:21 CEVUK00</p>\n\n<p>B) And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and <strong>give to</strong> the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” Mark 10:21 ESV</p>\n\n<p>C) Jesus looked at him and loved him. “One thing you lack,” he said. “Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” Mark 10:21 NIV</p>\n\n<p>The collocation \"give to the poor\" sounds a little strange for me. May be give can be used without an object (give to... instead of give something to...).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Mark 9:29</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>D) And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out <strong>by anything but</strong> prayer.” (Mark 9:29 ESV)</p>\n\n<p>E) He replied, “This kind can come out <strong>only by</strong> prayer.” (Mark 9:29 NIV)</p>\n\n<p>F) Jesus answered, “That kind of spirit can only be forced out by prayer.” Mark 9:29 NCV</p>\n\n<p>G) Jesus answered, “Only prayer can force out that kind of demon.” Mark 9:29 CEVUK00</p>\n\n<p>I've checked the collocation \"by anything but\" in <a href=\"http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">COCA</a>. It is a useful tool to check how common an English structure is. In fact by anything but\" is very rarely used.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Mark 8:21</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>H) And he said to them, “<strong>Do you not</strong> <strong>yet</strong> understand?” (Mark 8:21 ESV)</p>\n\n<p>I) He said to them, “Do you still not understand?” (Mark 8:21 NIV)</p>\n\n<p>J) Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand <strong>yet</strong>?” (Mark 8:21 NCV)</p>\n\n<p>\"Don't you understand yet\" sounds for me better as \"Do you not yet understand?\" because in most cases the \"yet\" is placed at the end of the phrase in a question. What do you think about this structure?</p>\n\n<p>Are there some structures mentioned in this Bible passages (from A to J) which do not use appropiate english syntax?

Consider the\n  difference between a so-called dynamic adjective (or subject\n  complement) and a stative adjective (or subject complement): \"I am\n  silly\" OR \"I am being silly\" versus \"I am tall.\" I have chosen to be\n  silly; I have no choice about being tall. Thus \"tall\" is said to be a\n  stative (or an \"inert\") quality, and we cannot say \"I am being tall\";\n  \"silly,\" on the other hand, is dynamic so we can use progressive verb\n  forms in conjunction with that quality.</p>\n  \n  <p>The same applies to verbs. Two plus two equals four. Equals is inert,\n  stative, and cannot take the progressive; there is no choice, no\n  volition in the matter. (We would not say, \"Two plus two is equalling\n  four.\") In the same way, nouns and pronouns can be said to exhibit\n  willed and unwilled characteristics. Thus, \"She is being a good\n  worker\" (because she chooses to be so), but we would say \"She is (not\n  is being) an Olympic athlete\" (because once she becomes an athlete she\n  no longer \"wills it\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, cannot 'the look you will have' be interpreted as a 'choice' or a 'willed' quality, similar to what is mentioned in the last part of the text I've quoted?
