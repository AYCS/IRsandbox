Also note, when talking about driving in general, <a href=\"http://www.driving-test-success.com/uk-road-signs.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>bend</em></a> is characteristically British English (<em>eg</em>, <a href=\"http://www.driving-test-success.com/driving-articles/bends.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>driving through a bend</em></a>), whereas <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_the_United_States#W1_Series:_Curves_and_Turns\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>curve</em> (or <em>turn</em>)</a> is used in American English.

This is more of a word-hunt than programming.</p>\n\n<p>In short, I have a Database for a Web Application with different concepts \nwithin them, like <em>Users</em>, <em>Courses</em>, <em>Lessons</em>, etc. These concepts can\nhave any name, but because I’m picky, I like to use one-word names for my\nconcepts.</p>\n\n<p>To explain how these concepts are related: I have <em>Lessons</em>, which are \nday-to-day exercises, like “Read this article”, or “Watch this video”.\nThey’re typically about learning a small subset of a broader subject, like\nlearning a Formula in a Math Class.</p>\n\n<p>Then I have <em>Series</em>, which is the word in question that I would like to \nreplace. Anyways, a <em>Series</em> is simply a collection of <em>Lessons</em>, to cover\na general subset of a broader subject. This would be like learning about\nQuadratic Equations in Algebra. Each Formula is a <em>Lesson</em>, Quadratic\nEquations is the <em>Series</em>, and Algebra is the <em>Course</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As you might have guessed, the third concept involved is <em>Courses</em>.
