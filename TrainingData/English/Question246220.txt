There are (at least) two possible pronunciation patterns for words ending in the plural suffix <em>-ata</em> (corresponding to <em>-a</em> in the singular). </p>\n\n<p>It appears that it is always possible to place the stress on the antepenult, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lemma\" rel=\"nofollow\">lémma ~ lémmata</a> /ˈlɛmə/~/ˈlɛmətə/, </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schema\" rel=\"nofollow\">schéma ~ schémata</a> /ˈskiːmə/~/ˈskiːmətə/</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/teratoma\" rel=\"nofollow\">teratóma ~ teratómata</a> /ˌtɛrəˈtoʊmə/~/ˌtɛrəˈtoʊmətə/</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stigma\" rel=\"nofollow\">stígma~stígmata</a> /ˈstɪɡmə/~/ˈstɪɡmətə/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is what would be expected from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_English_pronunciation_of_Latin#Stress\" rel=\"nofollow\">the stress rules of Latin</a> (I believe most or all of these words came through Latin before entering English), since the penultimate \"a\" in the original Greek words is short.\nMaybe these rules are not very relevant; I did just notice (reminded by some comments in this <a href=\"http://languagehat.com/niche/#comment-2168254\" rel=\"nofollow\">Languagehat blog post</a>) that even with antepenult stress, these pronunciations are not exactly in accordance with the traditional rules for pronouncing Latin-derived terms in English: the vowel \"should\" be shortened due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisyllabic_laxing\" rel=\"nofollow\">trisyllabic laxing</a> (TSL), yielding the hypothetical, unattested pronunciations ?/ˈskɛmətə/ and ?/ˌtɛrəˈtɒmətə/ (compare to <em>genus</em>~<em>genera</em> /dʒiːnəs/~/dʒɛnərə/ and perhaps <em>opus</em>~<em>opera</em> /oʊpəs/~/ɒpərə/). However, there are other Latinate plural forms that never have TSL (<em>matrices, helices</em>), or where both the lax- and tense-voweled pronunciations coëxist (<em>codices, apices</em>), so the lack of it would not be surprising (there are even some exceptions that are singular nouns like <em>obesity</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The other pronunciation seems to exist only for a couple of words, in which the penultimate \"a\" is commonly stressed and broadened: stigma ~ stigmáta <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=stigma03&amp;word=stigmata&amp;text=%5Cstig-%CB%88m%C3%A4-t%C9%99%2C%20%CB%88stig-m%C9%99-t%C9%99%5C\" rel=\"nofollow\">/stɪgˈmɑˑtɐ/</a> (listed by both the Merriam-Webster dictionary and the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/stigmata?q=stigmata\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxford Learner's Dictionaries</a>), and also sometimes schéma ~ schemáta /skiːˈmɑːtə/ (listed only by the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/schema?q=schema\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxford Learner's Dictionaries</a>). (Neither the Merriam-Webster dictionary nor the Oxford Learner's Dictionaries list *\"lemmáta\").  I'm wondering why this pronunciation exists. It's still irregular, and the stressed syllable changes between the singular and the plural forms.</p>\n\n<p>(It's true that all of these words are rare, and some people might pronounce some of their plurals differently. The pronunciations I give here are simply the ones listed in dictionaries.)</p>\n\n<p>The plural form \"stigmata\" is probably most common in religious or theological contexts (where it refers to the wounds of Christ), so at first I wondered if the penultimate stress was supposed to be closer to the original Greek pronunciation, but according to <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%B3%CE%BC%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiktionary</a>, the stress is on the antepenult in Greek as well.</p>\n\n<p>So, what's up with this? Did the stress perhaps change in Latin over time, is this a tradition of Greek accentuation that I'm not familiar with, is this a simple matter of ignorance of the original position of the stress that has now become entrenched with time and usage, or is this somehow explainable by established English stress patterns? (For example, do English speakers have some natural preference for a penultimate stress on polysyllabic words?)</p>\n\n<p>If nobody knows of a reason, I suppose I can just put it down to people encountering the word mainly in text, not knowing which syllable to stress, and choosing the penult because it sounds better to them.</p>\n\n<p>(I asked this question a while back on <a href=\"http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/position-of-stress-in-stigmata.2936624/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wordreference</a>, but nobody knew of any reason.)</p>\n"},{"id":31991,"title":"Why does the ending -ough have six pronunciations?","body":"<p>There are \"cough\", \"tough\", \"bough\", \"through\", and \"though\" (and \"hiccough\", if you're not from the U.S.); each of which has a different pronunciation for the ending \"-ough\".

Why is that not spelled \"tuff\"?  \"Bough\", \"through\", and \"though\" should be spelled \"bow\", \"thrue\" (or \"thru\"), and \"thoe\".  Where did \"-ough\" come from?  And then \"hiccough\".

Sometimes due to the great divide between English spellings and the true pronunciation, people will say words phonetically if they haven't heard them in speech before (particularly foreigners, but native speakers too).</p>\n\n<p>Where words aren't often used in speech but people know how to spell them English speakers pronounce the word phonetically, even though it's technically \"wrong\". </p>\n\n<p>My question has 2 parts. The first refers to words like cache, where the majority of people will read it as \"kashé\" (IPA symbols too much effort to insert), when it's actually meant to be read as \"kash\" due to its spelling. But, because of the sheer number of speakers that don't say it correctly, it becomes part of the language, and the original pronunciation seems incorrect. What is this phenomenon referred to? An example of other words are here <a href=\"http://www.vocabulary.com/lists/432678#view=notes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.vocabulary.com/lists/432678#view=notes</a>. None of these are \"mispronunciations\" in modern English, which is why I'm adamant that the answer isn't just \"mispronunciation\".</p>\n\n<p>The next part is for words that English imports from other languages, then mispronounces. In particular, words such as Qatar (which is a bad transcription of Katur), but also words like sudoku, which English speakers usually read as \"su<strong>du</strong>ku\" rather than su<strong>do</strong>ku.

For the most part, he should have no trouble speaking RP like a native. Yet he would never in a million years figure out on his own that <i>lieutenant</i> should be pronounced \"leftenant,\" for example, or that <i>controversy</i> is often pronounced with the accent on the second syllable, unless he hears those specific words pronounced. To my knowledge, there are no general characteristics of RP that account for the mysterious appearance of an <i>f</i> in <i>lieutenant</i> (or, if you prefer, there are no general characteristics of General American that account for its absence).
