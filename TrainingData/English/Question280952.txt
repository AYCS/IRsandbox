The work in question is one of the volumes for a Complete Works series. MLA says to cite a work that occupies an entire volume as though it were a single-volume book (<a href=\"https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/06/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/06/</a>). However, the author doesn't want to lose the information about which volume number a particular cited work has.

Vol. 13 of Obras completas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem is that MLA style doesn't seem to allow for the \"extra information\" after the year. The author wants to maintain perfect MLA compatibility, and with this particular entry I don't know how to give it to him.</p>\n"},{"id":168070,"title":"How do I submit a villanelle in MLA style?","body":"<p>I understand how to submit essays in MLA styles, but how do I submit a villanelle?</p>\n"},{"id":105770,"title":"What&#39;s the correct way to cite the name &quot;King James I&quot; in an MLA works cited page?","body":"<p>I'm writing a paper on <em>Daemonologie in Forme of a Dialogue</em>, and I was wondering how I should cite King James I in my works cited page.
