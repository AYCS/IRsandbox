As the subject matter tends to be difficult, I have made it a habit to augment each potentially confusing phrase with a clarification. The abbreviation <em>i.e.</em> has become my trusted tool for this task.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have never been very satisfied with <em>i.e.</em>, mostly because I am beginning to use it like a unique grammatical construct, even though it is just an abbreviation. My problem is that I find the commonly cited synonym \"that is\" to be <em>worse</em>, I think it breaks the flow of sentences too much.</p>\n\n<p>Let me demonstrate this with a typical example</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Assume that this is not true, i.e. that there are counterexamples X and Y such that the statements <code>Y &lt; X</code> and <code>X &lt; 2Y</code> are false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I want to replace \"i.e.\" by \"that is\", I have to remove the second \"that\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Assume that this is not true, that is there are counterexamples X and Y such that the statements <code>Y &lt; X</code> and <code>X &lt; 2Y</code> are false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but I find this version to be less readable than the original. The reason is that the <em>i.e.</em> invites the reader to repeat the preceding clause, i.e. the reader can enhance the flow by reading it as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Assume that this is not true, i.e. (<em>assume</em>) that there are counterexamples X and Y such that the statements <code>Y &lt; X</code> and <code>X &lt; 2Y</code> are false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I wanted to enhance readability with \"that is\", I would have to repeat a part of the first clause explicitely in the text</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Assume that this is not true, that is <em>assume that</em> there are counterexamples X and Y such that the statements <code>Y &lt; X</code> and <code>X &lt; 2Y</code> are false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Such explicit repetition would grow old really fast, though.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying problem seems to be that the phrase \"that is\" carries no meaning by itself, it is again a shorthand for \"which means that\", \"this says that\" or \"in other words\".</p>\n\n<p>My question is:</p>\n\n<p>What are other alternatives to <em>i.e.</em> that can I use in the sentence above?</p>\n"},{"id":146467,"title":"Relatively to each other — less awkward word?","body":"<p>I'm rating the performance of things in different dimensions on a scale, e.g. <code>[--, -, 0, +, ++]</code>.

There are fresh Oreos, and then there are two different ways they can go stale: dry/hard (in low humidity) and soft/mushy (in high humidity). To me, the dry/hard stale and the soft/mushy stale are opposites of each other, but they are also opposites of fresh as well.</p>\n\n<p>Now to give another example is apathy. The opposite of apathy is to feel strongly. Which could be both love and hate, which are both opposites of each other. I could love stale Oreos, I could hate stale Oreos, or I could feel completely apathetic about stale Oreos. All three of these seem to be mutually opposite of the other.</p>\n\n<p>But also think of something too with things like sexism and racism and other political correctness where it's possible to go so over-corrective that it becomes its own offensive antithesis to both PC and non-PC alike. (I can't really think of a way to lighten this one with Oreos...)</p>\n\n<p>I found the term <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autoantonym\" rel=\"nofollow\">autoantonym</a> which seems to help a little bit with the relationship. I also know that in art and design you would call it a color triad where three colors are as far from each other on the spectrum as possible. However this still seems to come up short in trying to solve my existential Oreo issue...</p>\n\n<p>*EDIT Ah! So let me add one last element to the question. In each instance where I think this situation could apply, I think we go from two words, A and B which appear to be binary opposites. It can either be A or not A. <em>But</em> when you add word/concept C which is both not A and not B, you either have a natural transition where it's possible to smoothly take the conversation to a broader or narrower scope (like emotions with love, hate and apathy). <em>OR</em> you could have a more unnatural transition where there isn't a clearly defined word for C (as far as I can tell there really isn't a word for that humid kind of stale. And that sad state of affairs really should have its own word, right?). And at the end of all this, it seems like we're trying to find a Word C even now... </p>\n"},{"id":101515,"title":"Word to describe things that run after each other","body":"<p>Is there a word to describe tasks that need to \"run one after the other\"?
