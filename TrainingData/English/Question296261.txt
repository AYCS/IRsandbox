Available on the album <em>Tubleweed Connection</em>. See the <a href=\"http://www.google.cz/search?&amp;q=elton+john+where+to+now+st+peter+lyrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">whole lyric</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>I found myself translating Elton's songs into Czech and I am curious about the meaning of \"blue canoe\". Here is what I have:</p>\n\n<p>According to my friend, \"blue canoe\" had been used by the soldiers of Confederation during the civil war in the USA meaning a \"bullet\". Now this would make some sense:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I took myself a blue canoe [I shot myself to death],<br>\n  And I floated like a leaf [towards the afterlife]<br>\n  Dazzling, dancing half enchanted [I shot myself badly / the wrong way, dying hours in horrible pain]<br>\n  In my Merlin sleep [in a sleep there is no waking from].</p>\n  \n  <p>Crazy was the feeling<br>\n  Restles were my eyes [this follows the scheme above]<br>\n  Insane they took the paddles [my hands took the \"paddles of the canoe\" = gun],<br>\n  My arms they paralysed [\"my paralysed hands\", my hands fell down after the gunshot].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am a little skeptic about this interpretation. First of all, I find it improbable that Taupin would describe \"dying hours in horrible pain\" this way; it is neither touching nor fun. There are hands falling down after the gunshot, as well as \"dancing in pain\". The music Elton John composed to this lyric is far beyond psychedelic, further deepening my doubts. And, one more thing that does not match at all:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It took a sweet young foreign gun<br>\n  This lazy life is short<br>\n  Something for nothing always ending<br>\n  With a bad report.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why would a gun be \"sweet\" or \"young\"? Now this could be allegorical expression of a \"young soldier\", but at the very beginning of the song, he claims himself to be the executor of whatever causes him to die.</p>\n\n<p>I have come with a different idea: \"blue canoe\" could be some elusive drug / poisonous substance, contained (for example) in the seeds or blossoms of a (tropical) flower that is blue in color. This would make sense to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I took myself a blue canoe [I have eaten a poisonous flower blue in color],<br>\n  And I floated like a leaf [I have been disoriented]<br>\n  Dazzling, dancing half enchanted [I could not control my body]<br>\n  In my Merlin sleep [in a sleep there is no waking from]</p>\n  \n  <p>Crazy was the feeling<br>\n  Restless were my eyes [kaleidoscopic vision or other vision distortion]<br>\n  Insane they took the paddles [my insane hands took the drug]<br>\n  My arms they paralysed [my hands, now paralysed].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This goes with the verse \"It took a sweet young foreign gun\" meaning fruits, seeds or blossoms of a flower that are blue in color and sweet in taste, that come from a foreign land he finds himself (fighting) and that are \"young\" meaning unripe, thus poisonous as it is typical for some flowers.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it goes well together with the Merlin; the association between Merlin and shooting myself to death is in my opinion much weaker than the association between Merlin and a poisonous substance, a \"spell\" that causes \"my Merlin sleep\".</p>\n\n<p>I have been looking \"blue canoe\" up in the Merriam-Webster On-line Dictionary without success, I failed to find it in my books, too.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone knows the meaning of \"blue canoe\", please do let me know. If you see any imperfection in the way I come to understand this, please do the same. I will be grateful for everyone's opinion on these two interpretations of the song.</p>\n"},{"id":285532,"title":"Origin and meaning of &quot;money isn&#39;t money isn&#39;t money&quot;","body":"<p>I have recently encountered the expression \"<strong><em>money isn't money isn't money</em></strong>\" twice.
