[{"id":294525,"title":"Usage of &quot;please + imperative&quot; and politness","body":"<p>I'm wondering about the rudeness of the imperative mood, particularly in a professional context. I recently wrote these 2 sentences: </p>\n\n<p>\"Please consider doing 2 tickets when you have 2 different issues.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Please stop entering multiple problems in a single ticket. This is problematic for follow-up and resolution.\" (as an escalation because the first demand had resulted in no change)</p>\n\n<p>They have been judged as extremely rude and impolite by my co-workers. I won't use this structure anymore in this particular context. But since this is a structure I have been using for years I would like to know how rude this construction is. Can it be used in formal and professional context or should it be restricted to familiar style ?</p>\n\n<p>As none of me or my co-workers are native speakers, I'm interested in gathering the opinion of experts on this structure. </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":274865,"title":"Usage of &quot;imperative to [verb]ing&quot;","body":"<p>From what I learned, we could use <em>imperative to [verb]ing</em>, but when I read my book, I see this sentence: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An accurate analysis of surveys is <strong>imperative to building</strong> a good understanding of customer needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why do we use <em>building</em> here?</p>\n\n<p>Please help :)</p>\n"},{"id":122379,"title":"Usage of &quot;to be across&quot;","body":"<p>I have only recently encountered <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/across\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"to be across\"</a>, meaning \"to understand fully\".

For example, if the student works at MediaTek, they will say \"We cooperate with Sony and HTC for mobile chip design.\"</p>\n\n<p>In looking in several dictionaries, the first definition is always \"to work together toward a common goal,\" however the example sentences do not have \"work together\" as the feeling but \"do something you don't really want to do.\"  For example, \"ask the child to cooperate and go to bed.\" I have heard sentences such as \"The suspect is cooperating with authorities,\" or \"Her child is uncooperative in class and causes disruptions.\"</p>\n\n<p>I always thought cooperate has this feeling of \"forced\" or \"unwillingly obliges.\"  Before coming to Taiwan, I never heard people use \"cooperate\" in the sense of \"work with another company.\"  I usually suggest \"We work with HTC and Sony.\" as a better choice.  Also, they will sometimes say \"I need to / must cooperate with my customers.\"  This usage seems to support my idea of the word, however when I ask for further details they don't feel \"unwilling\" to work with customers.  Some do, though.</p>\n\n<p>Does cooperate mean to work together without any emotional feelings or willingness or obligation?  Is cooperate a neutral word?</p>\n"},{"id":250575,"title":"On the usage: Yes, please","body":"<p>I was watching a movie.

The essay was about the literary genre of Exilliteratur - literature written by dissident or antifascist writers who left Germany during the Nazi era. To cut things short, I was trying to make the point that some of the authors picked topics for their aesthetical qualities (and not because they were trying to make a political point). </p>\n\n<p>Can I use 'aesthetical qualities' in this way? i.e. to refer to properties of texts that authors find attractive or pleasing? My professor said that I may have meant literary features. Any insight on this word would be much appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you!
