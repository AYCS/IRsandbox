In addition, when people say sentences like \"It's starting to rain\" and \"It's starting to bleed\" the actions (rain, bleed) have already began and are continuing, but when using a sentence like \"He is starting to sit\" the action of \"sit\" is still in the middle of being completed and he has not actually sat down yet.
