Three explanations are given here, but they are not very convincing (I am not a native speaker). </p>\n\n<p>In one of our newspapers, someone gives an explanation. Apparently, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Duke of Wellington, the man who defeated Napoleon Bonaparte in the\n  Battle of Waterloo in 1815, though quite the ladies man, wasn’t really\n  much to look at. The most prominent feature of his not-so-handsome\n  face was his rather long nose. The officers and the men who served\n  beneath him began to affectionately refer to any nose which was\n  unusually long as ‘duke’. With the passage of time, this word began to\n  be used to refer to any nose; of whatever size. Since human fists are\n  notorious to be employed in fights to put a ‘duke’ out of joints,\n  fists began to be called ‘duke buster’. Soon, the word ‘buster’ was\n  dropped, and everyone started referring to fists as ‘dukes’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like a great story, but he did not cite any references. Since this explanation is so very different from many others available on-line, I wonder if there is some reliable reference in support of his claim. </p>\n"},{"id":239281,"title":"What does this sentence mean: &quot;You watched his face crack open and your world shifted, ...&quot;?","body":"<p>quoted from: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To Forget: The look on your son’s face when you accused him of taking fifty dollars out of your purse.

(That is, what does actually “putting a wrinkle on a horn” entail? Does it mean wrenching an animal's—say, a bull's or a ram's—horn out of shape? Or something else?)</p></li>\n  <li><p>What is its figurative meaning?</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My initial impression is that the phrase figuratively means something like \"throw one for a loop,\" but that inference is based entirely on the context supplied by the three examples given below. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><em>Preliminary Research</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In an Ngram-based Google Books search of the years 1700–1900, the earliest instance of this idiomatic phrase occurs in Thomas Halliburton, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=m_sNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=%22put+a+wrinkle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d35SVN79HJG2oQSIp4C4BQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22put%20a%20wrinkle%22&amp;f=false\"><em>The Clockmaker; or The Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick of Slickville</em></a> (1838), where a Yankee-dialect speaker is being \"quoted\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yes, said he, so I have often heerd tell ; and I have heerd, too, that the new ones [packet ships] won't lay to, and the old ones won't scud ; grand chance in a gale for  feller that, ain't it?

My first understanding of the idiom was that he will do something so fast that, if I was wearing a wig or something it will fly away. I have checked the meaning and it was <em>to keep calm, not get angry and overreact</em>. I have no idea how I am going to loose my hair if I get angry hence where this idiom comes from?</p>\n\n<p>I have Googled and read something about <strong><em>keep your shirt on</em></strong> was the original expression and came from the days when ordinary man had two shirts and he had to take off his precious shirt before getting in a fight. ( <em>First recorded in the USA in George W. Harris's 1854 book Spirit of the Times: 'I say, you durned ash cats, just keep yer shirts on, will ye?'</em>) </p>\n\n<p>Keep your hair on was some sort of humorous development of this, but I still don't get how you are going to lose your hair if you get angry, not that all expressions have to make sense but I find it peculiar. Is it connected with the phrase <strong><em>let your hair down</em></strong>? The phrase comes from the same time period when women had to wear their hair  pinned up on the head in public. They were only allowed to let their hair down to hang naturally when alone, either when bathing or at bedtime. The phrase means merely to relax and to go easy.</p>\n\n<p><em>What is the more popular phrase today that one with the hair or with shirt ?
