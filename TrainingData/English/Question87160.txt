What particularly amazed me there is how many people can't comprehend spoken English. DA asks questions in a very slow, clear, monotonous voice without any emotion, and questions are all grammatically correct. He obviously does this as a job for years. Yet, about half of the witnesses, one after another just don't understand his questions. They kept asking \"Can you repeat the question?\" And I could see the struggling expression on their face. Most witnesses were in 20-25 age range, all studied in the US high schools, and most have BA degrees of some kind.</p>\n\n<p>The factor that triggered this, I think, is that questions were a bit more complex than usual, for example: <em>When was the first time you met the defendant or anybody related to him in any way?</em></p>\n\n<p>I didn't even go to English language high school, my school was in completely different language, and while seating in the last row in the audience, I still understood every single question, and I think almost every nuance of every question.</p>\n\n<p>My question is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there an English word describing a person who can't comprehend the correct and clearly audible speech?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can only wonder how much would they be able to comprehend when somebody would speak very fast and not very clearly.</p>\n"},{"id":255716,"title":"Single word for someone who doesn&#39;t let anyone walk all over them (antonym of &#39;pushover&#39;)","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>She was caring, and yet she was _______</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I'm tring to say is that although she cared for others, she was strong enough to not let them dictate her actions.
