The book itself is not a piece of music (any more than Magritte's painting was <em>of</em> a pipe).  Only the <em>sound</em> of music is music.  It is also my view (and among musicians I'm not out on any kind of limb!) that wonderful and awe-inspiring as music theory is to me, it is based on the work of a succession of rule-breaking composers.
