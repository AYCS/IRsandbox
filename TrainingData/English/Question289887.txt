If there are no \n  other mentions of the acronym later in the copy, then you just spell it out without the \n  acronym in parentheses. Is this correct? My coworker is debating this with me. </p>\n  \n  <p>A. Yes, that’s a good system. Sometimes it’s helpful to repeat the full name in later \n  chapters as a reminder.
