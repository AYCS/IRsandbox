I don't see any difference in:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If I had played football  </p>\n  \n  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vs  </p>\n  \n  <p>If I were to have played football</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>besides the aspect of formality and emphasis, so why would there be any difference between the two sentences in question?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":229772,"title":"What&#39;s the truth about the subjunctive and conditional statements, anyway?","body":"<p>I have generally (I would say always, but I'm not sure I always thought this) supposed that in English, uses of the subjunctive are quite limited. They include desires, judgments, etc. (\"I desire that she go\"), general propositions (\"the very idea that he marry her\"), assorted hypotheticals involving to be (\"If I were mad\"), and some archaic expressions that you can find in Shakespeare.</p>\n\n<p>Now, in pursuing a question for someone, I find myself confronted with the possibility that many ordinary conditionals in English are in fact subjunctive-carriers. Some sources omit mention of the subjunctive; some state that it's only the \"type two\" conditional that takes the subjunctive (\"If I got up early every morning...\"); and some seem to imply that just about every conditional statement is really a subjunctive one. </p>\n\n<p>My first point of concession is that, on some inspection, this so called second type might really be a subjunctive after all; if the protasis \"if I were\" is subjunctive, then \"if I liked\" must be as well. </p>\n\n<p>But after this point, it gets quite murky. Do you really mean to say that a standard pluperfect conditional construction, such as \"If I had gone along, I would have had fun\" really contains the subjunctive mood in one or both pieces? </p>\n\n<p>Now that I think about it, the indicative mood doesn't seem quite right, and surely there must be some mood happening, but the subjunctive? One thing that I am quite sure of is that in this kind of conditional, there is nothing about it that would ever differentiate it from indicative anyway: \"If I had gone along\" and \"I had gone along\" have no difference in inflection. </p>\n\n<p>Does that mean that the subjunctive is imputed simply by virtue of uncertainty or doubt? That would mean that the most simple type of conditional, a present-future conditional, is subjunctive also: \"If I fail, you'll hate me\". The thing is, the more I inspect these fragments, the more conceivable it becomes; aren't we really saying \"given that I fail\", which has the look of a subjunctive to it? </p>\n\n<p>However, this is where I hesitate. If mere doubt is the condition to require the subjunctive mood, that would mean that \"I'm not sure if he is rich\" is subjunctive, when we know that it is not, and that to try to employ it (\"I'm not sure if he be rich\") makes us sound like a pirate. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I have the sound of French teachers too much in my ear, telling me that the subjunctive is rarely used in English in comparison with the far more robust French equivalent. Can someone please sort this out?</p>\n"},{"id":196739,"title":"What is the opposite of &#39;subjunctive&#39;?","body":"<p>Any verb has a <em>mood</em>, a <em>voice</em> and a <em>tense</em>.

The MySQL website currently claims over 10 million installations, its server is available for free, and I have found its server to be extremely simple to download and install. For these reasons, I have decided that <strong>all examples for this book be run</strong> against a MySQL (version 6.0) database, and that <strong>the mysql command-line tool be used</strong> to format query results.

We don't want to introduce any doubt that A will not result in B.</p>\n\n<p>And, I've read that there is no future subjunctive in English.  </p>\n\n<p>Is there a correct answer?</p>\n"},{"id":174270,"title":"Subjunctive and conditionals","body":"<p>This is another subjunctive and conditional question. I am interested in the formal, even archaic, uses, not just the modern uses (I am given to understand that the subjunctive is disappearing from use, for the most part). I am interested to know if my examples are accurate, if there is anything important I have missed, and finally there is a specific question on the use of the subjunctive in mixed conditionals. If you feel there is anything important that needs to be borne in mind concerning subjunctives, please include it.</p>\n\n<p>According to The University of Ottawa Writing centre <a href=\"http://arts.uottawa.ca/writingcentre/en/hypergrammar/using-verbs\" rel=\"nofollow\">(here)</a>, the subjunctive is used: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\"...in dependent clauses to express unreal conditions...\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>My attempt: If I <em>were</em> a skilled footballer, I should be rich.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"...in dependent clauses following verbs of wishing or requesting.\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>My attempt: I wish I <em>were</em> a skilled footballer.</p>\n\n<p>My attempt: I insisted he <em>call</em> her today.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely enough, It doesn't seem to be used with \"hope\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>The subjunctive mood is used in a dependent clause attached to an independent clause that uses a verb such as \"ask,\" \"command,\" \"demand,\" \"insist,\" \"order,\" \"recommend,\" \"require,\" \"suggest,\" or \"wish.\"</blockquote>\n\n<p>My attempt: The king ordered the soldier be shackled, before he <em>escape</em>. (Setting aside the issue of whom the pronoun \"he\" belongs to, is \"escape\", as oppose to \"escapes\", correct?)</p>\n\n<blockquote>The subjunctive mood is also used in a dependent clause attached to an independent clause that uses an adjective that expresses urgency (such as \"crucial,\" \"essential,\" \"important,\" \"imperative,\" \"necessary,\" or \"urgent\"). </blockquote>\n\n<p>My attempt: Melinda said that it is necessary that she <em>skip</em> through the park; it makes her feel better.</p>\n\n<p>On the wiki page for conditionals <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_conditional_sentences\" rel=\"nofollow\">(here)</a>, if identifies zero, first, second, third and mixed (second and third) conditionals.</p>\n\n<p>The zero conditional can make use of the subjunctive, according to wikipedia, but this is archaic:</p>\n\n<p>wiki example: <blockquote>\"If the prisoner be held for more than five days, ...\"</blockquote></p>\n\n<p>My attempt: When/If there <em>be</em> light rain, the ground will be moist.</p>\n\n<p>The subjunctive is used in second conditionals, and I believe this is the same as the first example (expressing unreal conditions).</p>\n\n<p>Wiki example: <blockquote>\"If I (he, she, it)... were rich, there would be plenty of money available for this project.\"</blockquote></p>\n\n<p>The third conditional is used \"to refer to hypothetical situations in a past time frame, generally counterfactual... Here the condition clause is in the past perfect, and the consequence is expressed using the conditional perfect.\" So, despite being counterfactual, or percieved to be counterfactual, there is no subjunctive (perhaps it is equivalent in form and therefore is ignored/\"doesn't exist\".</p>\n\n<p>Wiki example: <blockquote>\"If you had called me, I would have come.\"</blockquote></p>\n\n<p>Having established this, I am confused by the mixed conditional.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\"\"Mixed conditional\" usually refers to a mixture of the second and third conditionals (the counterfactual patterns). Here either the condition or the consequence, but not both, has a past time reference... When the consequence refers to the past, but the condition is not expressed as being limited to the past, <strong>the condition clause is expressed as in the second conditional (past, but not past perfect)</strong>, while the main clause is in the conditional perfect as in the third conditional:\n\n        If we were soldiers, we wouldn't have done it like that.\" (emphasis mine)</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the \"condition clause\" is from the second conditional, why does it not feature the subjunctive? My attempt: If I <em>were</em> a soldier, I wouldn't have done it like that.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to thank everyone for their contributions; I am expanding the post due to feedback as there is clearly more to consider regarding the subjunctive.</p>\n\n<p>I am unclear as to the differences between the irrealis and the subjunctive. It has been pointed out that they are related; I get the impression that the irrealis is just the exception to the rule for how to form the subjunctive in \nthe past:</p>\n\n<p>The present subjunctive, both are the bare infinitive:</p>\n\n<p>To learn: I insisted that he learn to appreciate hats.</p>\n\n<p>To be: I insisted that he be a hat connoisseur.</p>\n\n<p>The past subjunctive is the exception: all taking the simple past, except to be:</p>\n\n<p>To smell: I insisted that he smelt hats.</p>\n\n<p>To be: I wish that he were a hat-smeller.</p>\n\n<p>To me, it doesn't seem to have a different role.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is the future subjunctive. Here, again, \"were\" pops-up:</p>\n\n<p>To manufacture: If I were to manufacture hats, I would never have to buy one again.</p>\n\n<p>To be: If I were to be a hat manufacturer, I would never have to buy a hat again.</p>\n\n<p>Were makes some (seemingly) random appearances...</p>\n\n<p>As for the archaic references, I wasn't too specific, my apologies.
