The Urban Dictionary indicates that \"<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jakers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jakers</a>\" is a euphemism for Jesus, so that does not help much.

Not only the title of William’s book, the words <em>Moral luck</em> are repeated four times in the following sentence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What Williams didn’t entirely register, though, was that Gauguin isn’t just one artist plucked at random out of time, a desperado in a line stretching back to Pygmalion. He’s not just an instance of <em>moral luck</em>; he is an inventor of <em>moral luck</em>. He is a model modern artist, and modern art is in many ways about <em>moral luck</em>, about the search for it, about raising the stakes to see if it can happen. Modern art makes its own <em>moral luck</em>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t understand the meaning of <em>Moral luck</em>. I checked the definition of <em>luck</em> with Cambridge Online Dictionary, which defines <em>luck</em> simply as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>The force that causes things, especially good things, to happen to you by chance and not as a result of your own efforts or abilities. 2.

Period.”</p>\n\n<p>I cannot even guess the meaning of <em>Moral luck</em> from any of the above definitions. To me, <em>Moral</em> doesn’t seem to sit well with <em>Luck</em>.
