(The size of a room is quantified in terms of the number of tatamis, e.g. a 6-tatami room or a 12-tatami room.)</p>\n\n<p>“To die on a tatami mat” originally meant “to end a peaceful life” without being subjected to such perils as war, fighting, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons as are rife in this country. By extension, we call a reckless person “a fellow who is unable to die on a tatami mat.” </p>\n\n<p>I associate “aging in place”, a term which I understand is current these days, with “dying on a tatami mat.” But the connotation is not the same.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any English-language expressions that are similar to the Japanese saying “I want to die on a tatami mat”?</p>\n"},{"id":214380,"title":"Meaning of &quot;X need not apply&quot;?","body":"<p>I've seen this a bunch of times before, largely in TV/movies, where someone will be looking at a job posting and it will say \"X need not apply\".
