In those, the pair (or sequence) of nouns stands in for a prepositional phrase, but in <em>a friend who is a banker</em> there is no preposition.

Generally this word only occurs in determiner function before noun phrases which are singular. However, there seem to be some cases where this determiner occurs before plural noun phrases. I say that, but actually these noun phrase seem so bizarre to me, in terms of their structure, that I'm not sure they're definitely noun phrases at all. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a full three months before we left</li>\n<li>an amazing two days</li>\n<li>an awkward ten minutes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ignoring the article here for a moment, these noun phrases are odd because the adjective is occurring <em>before</em> the numeral.

However, in each of the 4 cases listed above, I feel 'OK' saying them the 'English' way; that is, adjective-noun, which is the way we <em>almost always</em> do things except for these borrowed phrases.  One might receive a statement from the <em>General Attorney</em>, or be sent to a <em>Martial Court</em>.  My father is actually a lawyer and does indeed describe himself as a <em>Public Notary</em>.  Doing things this way makes the plural sound a lot more sensible in English, too; which sounds better: General Secretaries, or Secretaries General?</p>\n\n<p>How common is it for people to flip these borrowed phrases around and say them the more standard English adjective-noun way?
