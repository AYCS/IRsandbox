And the meaning is that somebody was there as a patient. </p>\n\n<p>If then for some other reasons British English speakers  will use the definite article which will change the meaning itself, I noticed that, in American English, native speakers often use the  <strong>the</strong> and if they need to show that somebody is in church to pray,  in school as a student, in hospital as a patient, in prison as a prisoner, they use 'in' and not 'at'. Do American English speakers use 'at' like British English speakers use 'the' to give the sentences a different meaning?  </p>\n\n<p>Are my sentences correct?

Same goes for mathematical objects. And let's say Modular Functions which even professors have a hard time explaining. How do we even explain what a modular function is to a person who doesn't understand the language of mathematics? We can explain it in the simplest terms but will possibly stop and say it can't be explained easily.
