There are several competing theories, none of which is definitive. The European tradition, which has long included giving money and other gifts to those who were needy and in service positions, has been dated to the Middle Ages, but the exact origin is unknown. It is believed to be in reference to the Alms Box placed in places of worship to collect donations to the poor.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://britishfood.about.com/od/christmas/p/boxingday.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Britishfood.about.com</a> lists four possible origins and says that it might be related to all of them:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A ‘Christmas Box’ in Britain is a name for a Christmas present.</li>\n<li>Boxing Day was a day off for servants and when they received a ‘Christmas Box’ from the master. The servants would also go home to give ‘Christmas Boxes’ to their families.</li>\n<li>A box to collect money for the poor was placed in Churches on Christmas day then opened the next day.</li>\n<li>Great sailing ships when setting sail would have a sealed box containing money on board for good luck.If the voyage were a success the box was given to a priest, opened at Christmas and the contents given to the poor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/boxingday.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">snopes.com</a> debunks most of the theories and gives the following origin as the best bet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The holiday's roots can be traced to Britain, where Boxing Day is also known as St. Stephen's Day. Reduced to the simplest essence, its origins are found in a long-ago practice of giving cash or durable goods to those of the lower classes. Gifts among equals were exchanged on or before Christmas Day,\n  but beneficences to those less fortunate were bestowed the day after.</p>\n  \n  <p>And that's about as much as anyone can definitively say about its origin because once you step beyond that point, it's straight into the quagmire of debated claims and dueling folklorists. Which, by the way, is what we're about to muddy our boots with. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Well, it looks like I already answered the question but different sources say different things.
