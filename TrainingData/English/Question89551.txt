This term seems to be largely heard in the US, where \"turkey\" has long been slang, in reference to the bird's legendary stupidity, for something (or someone) of little value, so there's a possibility that it is simply another derogatory sense of this slang \"turkey.\"</p></li>\n  <li><p>More likely, however, is the possibility that \"turkey\" in this sense is a development of \"Turk,\" a native of Turkey, which has long been used in a derogatory slang sense in many contexts to mean a person lacking \"civilized\" qualities. \"Turk\" has been used in the US as slang for a person of Irish birth or descent since at least 1914, while the form \"turkey\" in the same sense is first found in the 1930s.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Yet another possibility, bypassing Turkey entirely, is that \"turk\" and \"turkey\" in this sense is derived from the Irish word \"torc,\" meaning \"hog or boar.\"</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is a new study claims that Irishmen descended from Turkish farmers which might be related:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A new study has revealed that many Irish men may be able to trace their roots back to Turkey. Focusing on the role of the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son, the research indicates Turkish farmers arrived in Ireland about 6,000 years ago, bringing agriculture with them.
