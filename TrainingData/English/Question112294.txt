Where does \"skinner\" come from in this term, and why does it only apply to mule drivers and not cattle or oxen drivers?</p>\n\n<p>The closest I can come is some anecdotal evidence, namely that mule drivers would make the animals bleed when whipping them, thus exposing their skin. The same term, skinner, should apply to cattle drivers, but it doesn't. So, I'm guessing there is more to it. Does anyone know the derivation of skinner in this context, and why it only applies to mules? </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":89551,"title":"Why is a black eye called a &quot;shiner&quot;?","body":"<p>I saw a photograph of Chris Robshaw, the Harlequins captain, in the paper yesterday sporting a magnificent <em>shiner</em>, and naturally started to wonder where the term originated.</p>\n\n<p>Consulting <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=shiner&amp;searchmode=none\">Etymonline</a> revealed a date (1904) but no explanation.</p>\n\n<p>I also turned up a question on <a href=\"http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/34392\">Answerbag</a> stating that it is derived from the derogatory word <em>shiner</em> meaning a black person.

(See OED extract below)</p>\n\n<p>It has been the policy of the international community for many years to name new countries, (and rename old ones), to correspond with the way they are known to their own government and population. Thus <em>Abyssinia</em> became <em>Ethiopia</em>, the <em>Gold Coast</em> became <em>Ghana</em>, <em>Rhodesia</em> became (after partition) <em>Zambia</em> and <em>Zimbabwe</em>. (For a more complete list of name changes go to <a href=\"http://www.conservapedia.com/Renamed_countries\">http://www.conservapedia.com/Renamed_countries</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>Since there may be some evidence that it was only colonists (presumably from Rome to Euboea) that assigned the name <em>Greece</em>, why do we continue to use that name and why not <em>Hellas</em>?  After all we no longer refer to the USA as <em>The thirteen colonies</em>.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Forms:  pl.OE Cré(a)cas, Gré(a)cas, ME Greckes, Orm. Grickess, ME\n  Greks, Grekis, ME Grekys... (Show More) Etymology:  In branch I: The\n  Old English Crécas plural, corresponds to Old High German Chrêch ,\n  Chriech (Middle High German Kriech ), Gothic Krêks &lt; *Krêko-z , an\n  early Germanic adoption of Latin Graecus , plural Graecī (see below),\n  the name applied by the Romans to the people called by themselves\n  Ἕλληνες . The substitution of k for g is commonly accounted for by the\n  supposition that the Germanic initial g , when the word was adopted,\n  still retained its original pronunciation /ɣ/ , so that k would be the\n  Germanic sound nearest to the Latin g . In all the Germanic languages\n  the word was ultimately refashioned after Latin, with change of k into\n  g ; hence Old English Grécas plural beside Crécas , Middle Dutch\n  Grieke (Dutch Griek ), modern German Grieche , Old Norse Grikkir ,\n  plural. In branch II the noun is an absolute use of Greek adj. The\n  Latin Graecī is &lt; Greek Γραικοί, said by Aristotle ( Meteor. i. xiv)\n  to have been the prehistoric name of the Hellenes in their original\n  seats in Epirus. The word is apparently an adjectival derivative of\n  Graius, which is used in Latin as a poetical synonym of Graecus.\n  Recent scholars think the name may have been brought to Italy by\n  colonists from Euboea, where there is some evidence of its having\n  existed: see Busolt Gr.
