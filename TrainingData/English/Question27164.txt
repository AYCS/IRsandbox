From this latter term the name <a href=\"http://www.finedictionary.com/weevil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>weevil</em></a>, a small beetle, was probably derived. <em>Weave</em> was also the source for the Old English noun <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=web&amp;allowed_in_frame=0\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>webb</em></a> which meant \"woven fabric, woven work, tapestry\", whose meaning was later transformed to <em>web</em>, as in a <em>spider's</em> <strong><em>web</em></strong> (13th C) and <strong><em>cobweb</em></strong> (14th C).  </p>\n\n<p>From  the the related Middle Low German <em>wāfel</em> the term was loaned to Middle English (1377) and became <strong><em>wafer</em></strong>.

From <em>An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</em> (1808) by John Jamieson we gleam that since at least 1678, <em>waff</em> and <em>waif</em> meant \"the act of waving\" and \"to fluctuate\" whereas <em>waff</em> alone, denoted someone who was worthless. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>WAFF</strong> 3.

But it provides an additional definition under its <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/pluperfect\" rel=\"nofollow\">American English entry</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[as modifier] more than perfect:</p>\n  \n  <p><em>they have <strong>one pluperfect daughter</strong> and are expecting an ideal little brother for her</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pluperfect\" rel=\"nofollow\">Webster</a> defines its alternate sense as <em>utterly perfect or complete</em> along with a note on its origin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>late 15th century: from modern Latin <strong>plusperfectum</strong>, from Latin (tempus praeteritum) plus quam perfectum</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm curious as to how this odd-sounding construction made its way from the grammar book into common parlance. Is it used in this sense only in the US? Is it still in use?</p>\n\n<p>(Although I see it used in other languages, I believe that <em>pluperfect</em> is no longer the term of choice in English grammar.)</p>\n"}]}]
