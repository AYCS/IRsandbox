[{"id":296515,"title":"Commas Before Little Conjunctions","body":"<p>I've recently come upon a set of lines in a video game which either disregard the rule about commas having to come before little conjunctions (and, so, but) when separating two independent clauses, or is operating on a rule that I'm not familiar with.

'The plating is fairly strong' and 'I think you'll appreciate how lightweight the entire jacket will feel once the modification is made' are independent clauses respectively, are they not?</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, in terms of dialogue, do you HAVE to adhere to the 'comma before a small conjunction separates independent clauses' rule all the time?

The comma would certainly be there after the parenthetical if the conjunction is dropped and according to both <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/141/strunk.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Strunk, Jr, in Elements of Styles</a> and <a href=\"http://briananim.noip.me:9000/ftp/School/Gregg_reference_Manual_10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gregg Reference Manual, 10th Edition,</a> the comma, in analogues situation, should be dropped after the conjunction in the middle of the sentence if conjunction is starting a 2nd independent clause and is preceded by a parenthetical. See quotes below from each.</p>\n\n<p>Strunk: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction, place the first comma before the conjunction, not after it.</p>\n  \n  <p>He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery, greeted us with a smile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gregg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Section 142b</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>When the [transitional] expression or comment occurs at the beginning of the second independent clause in a compound sentence and is preceded by a comma and a coordinating conjunction, use one comma following the expression. </p>\n  \n  <p>The location of the plant was not easy to reach, and to be honest about it, I wasn't very taken\n  with the people who interviewed me.</p>\n  \n  <p>The job seemed to have no future, and to tell the truth, the salary was pretty low.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the first place, I think the budget for the project is unrealistic, and in the second place, the\n  deadlines are almost impossible to meet. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in section <strong><a href=\"http://briananim.noip.me:9000/ftp/School/Gregg_reference_Manual_10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">126b note</a></strong>, Gregg says the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not insert a comma directly after the coordinating conjunction unless a\n  parenthetical element begins at that point</p>\n  \n  <p>I told Calahan that we would not reorder unless he cut his prices by 20 percent And, to my total amazement, he did. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Surely the two guidelines he is giving contradict one another? Why does one need a parenthetical comma in the beginning of the sentence after a conjunction but not in the middle if the only difference is period instead of comma before a coordinating conjunction. </p>\n\n<p>So, according to Gregg, this is correct punctuation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I told Calahan that we would not reorder unless he cut his prices by 20 percent. And, to my total amazement, he did. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>BUT:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I told Calahan that we would not reorder unless he cut his prices by 20 percent, and to my total amazement, he did. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notice no comma in the second sentence. </p>\n\n<p>You could say that the first parenthetical comma could be dropped on the grounds of prettiness / clarity to avoid excessive punctuation but in this case:</p>\n\n<p>a) It's more logical to drop the comma preceding the coordinating conjunction (and retain the first parenthetical comma)</p>\n\n<p>b) If we were to punctuate the 2 sentences like Gregg advises, then the two sentences read differently as in the first one we are forcing a break / speech pause after a conjunction. And surely, the sentences should not be read differently just because the period before the coordinating conjunction is replaced by a comma? </p>\n\n<p>Is there a grammatical rule on this or in cases like that it's simply a style matter?</p>\n\n<p>I am asking because I personally prefer to drop the first parenthetical comma after a coordinating conjunction on the basis that coordinating conjunction does not have any syntactic role in the clause -- it simply connects the two clauses acting as connector making anything that comes after it an introductory element which would only have one comma in the beginning of the sentence if the conjunction is to be dropped? </p>\n\n<p>Also the natural speech pattern seems to suggest that and the rules above address this situation in the middle of the sentence but not in the beginning?</p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>A side question: if dropping the first parenthetical comma does turn out to be a mere style preference, would that be acceptable in the formal written works like academic reports and papers (logic being, if the rule is acceptable, it's acceptable in every writing piece).</p>\n"},{"id":254646,"title":"Comma before a conjunction that precedes an infinitive phrase?","body":"<p>I understand that a comma is used before \"and\" when the conjunction precedes an independent clause; however, I'm curious if the same rule applies when it precedes an infinitive phrase:</p>\n\n<p>\"It was my job to extract data necessary to determine the prevalences of rare mutations that could be lethal(,) and to ultimately calculate such statistics.\"</p>\n\n<p>Thank you! </p>\n"},{"id":234392,"title":"Should I use a comma before the conjunction in this sentence?","body":"<p>The sentence </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The movie was loud and the chatter was louder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Should I need to add a comma before the <code>and</code> that joins the first sentence <code>The movie was loud</code> and the independent clause <code>the chatter was louder</code>?</p>\n\n<p>Which one is correct?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>The movie was loud and the chatter was louder.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The movie was loud, and the chatter was louder.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not a native English speaker.
