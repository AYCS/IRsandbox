And hitherto, I have been very assured by the laid-down rules provided by this seemingly extraordinary and concise book; although judging by the rules proposed by users on this website, it certainly seems as if the rules whereby I have been composing \"grammatical\" English texts all this time, and sharing my knowledge with others here, are no longer in use! So, I surely seem to be in a tricky predicament, where I find myself uneasy to impart conceivably-outdated information! </p>\n\n<p>Do you suggest I abandon all which I've been taught by this book, or I alter the rules I reckon to be then-right but now-wrong, through meticulous comparisons for confirmation of validity?!</p>\n\n<p>Please note that in this book, the 2nd person singular pronoun is thou, and the 2nd person plural ye. However, I have easily learned to ignore these evidently-outdated pronouns, and instead simply use \"you\" for both cases (which is ridiculously unclear, due to the confusion of whether a crowd or an individual is the audience). </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your recommendations.</p>\n"},{"id":147575,"title":"A good and exhaustive book for English grammar","body":"<p>Before marking this post duplicate or voting to get it closed (the reason for which I simply don't get just because it is a grammar forum after all! If I am seeking recommendation for a book that means I will be coming back someday to the same site for my doubts also provided I get a not so harsh reply!), please read this and help this MBA aspirant. </p>\n\n<p>A little about myself and my research so far. I am a very critical reader of English Grammar and the kind of person who aims at perfection. \nCurrently, I am keen on taking on English grammar again after a certain gap. Well, I am aiming for MBA, so preparing for entrance exams for the same. \nI bought the religiously followed <strong>Wren and Martin</strong> and started studying it chapter by chapter. I was surprised when I read the pronouns chapter. I studied all the rules given and then started practising but it came as surprise when I found when many of the attempted questions were wrong. The reason simply being the rules for those specific sentences were not given. </p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We scored as many goals as they/them? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to me, the answer should be <em>they</em>, but it's <em>them</em> according to the solution manual. Worse still, the solution manual offers no explanation for this.</p>\n\n<p>So after a chat with my teachers I was suggested to follow the blogs of grammarians and look for any rules for the sentences that have contradictory answers!</p>\n\n<p>I did so and was clarified by <a href=\"http://www.grammarbook.com/grammar/pronoun.asp\">this</a> post of pronouns, Rule 5.</p>\n\n<p>Then I saw a book by the same author. I was momentarily happy. It was Momentarily because the reviews on Amazon were too bad about this book. After reading a couple of forums about the book I found a common statement saying that <em>no grammar book is exhaustive.</em></p>\n\n<p>So, it's okay for me to have more than one. And my simple question is what will be a good and <em>almost exhaustive</em> (if not fully exhaustive) book of English grammar to help get through the subtle usages of English in my management entrances  which is crisp and to the point and yet covers all important rules and syntax, and most importantly having <em>practice tests</em> at the end <em>with solutions</em> and explanations?</p>\n"},{"id":130003,"title":"Guide to check thesis grammar?","body":"<p>I'm new to the site.

During my elementary and middle school years, I self-studied the grammar of English via various books written by the most famous experts in my country, although these were beyond what were required by my curriculum. I am not saying my English is good enough now, but the study from the old days still helps me a lot for my life in U.S. later.</p>\n\n<p>After coming to U.S., I have often got my mind boggled by various usages of English either in talks or in prints, which seem to be inconsistent with what I have learned before.
