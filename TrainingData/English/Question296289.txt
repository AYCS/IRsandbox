So, he says to his friend:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hey, Person B! I've just been kicked out of my house and I have nowhere to go. I really have to figure out where to stay the next couple of days. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Person B understands that Person A is hoping that he would offer him to stay at his place. But he chooses to pretend not to understand, and, instead of saying sorry and explaining why Person A cannot stay at his place, person B says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There's a nice hotel near here, and it's not very expensive. I can give you the address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another example. Person B has secretly stolen the wallet of Person A. Person A has figured out that it was person B and when they meet, he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My wallet was stolen the other day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Person B says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Really?

I.e. pretending to be stupid or pretending not to understand something rather obvious, or pretending not to know something that you know; in other words, consciously imitating ignorance, indifference, or innocence.</p>\n\n<p>In Russian, the idiom is <em>to pretend to be a fire hose</em> (прикидываться шлангом) or <em>to pretend to be a boot</em> (прикидываться валенком). The Armenian idiom is <em>to pretend to be a donkey</em> (իրեն էշի տեղ դնել). For me, these phrases are not quite unimaginative and cause a certain amount of amusement. I am hoping to find an English equivalent (or equivalents) that would be informal and/or sound funny(-ish), but that's not essential.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, I tried to look up the translation in the dictionary before asking, but to no avail, presumably because the phrases mentioned above are rather informal.</p>\n"},{"id":267991,"title":"What do you call it when everything satisfies one condition or the other?","body":"<p>When something can be A or B but not both, A and B are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong>.
