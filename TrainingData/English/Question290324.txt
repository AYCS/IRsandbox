I found many sources that mentioned the quote-within-a-quote rule (switch to single quotes for the inner quote), but all the examples I ran across used cases where the inner quote was either a quote or title, not a scare quote. None of the grammar blogs or punctuation guides addressed the embedded scare quote problem. </p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Use single quotation marks for quotations within quotations.  </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>He said, “Dan cried, ‘Do not treat me that way.’ ”</em><br>\n    <sub><a href=\"http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/quotes.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a></sub></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The convention in American usage is to use double quotation marks (except for internal quotes) and to keep commas and periods inside final quote marks. The <em>Chicago Manual</em> gives this example of the normal usage:  </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p><em>“Admit it,” she said. “You haven’t read ‘The Simple Art of Murder.’ ”</em><br>\n    <sub><a href=\"http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2014/06/scare-quotes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a></sub></p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and from the <a href=\"https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/577/02/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Purdue OWL</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Quotations within a Quotation</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Use single quotation marks to enclose quotes within another quotation.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The reporter told me, \"When I interviewed the quarterback, he said they simply 'played a better game.'\"</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p><strong>Quotation Marks Beyond Quoting</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Quotation marks may additionally be used to indicate words used ironically or with some reservation.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The great march of \"progress\" has left millions impoverished and hungry.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I'm asking because a colleague asked me to review a report.

It appears to derive from intransitive <em>relate,</em> OED sense 9, attested only from 1947:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>intr.</em> With <em>to.</em> To understand or have empathy for; to identify or feel a connection with. Also without construction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most adjectives formed from verbs with suffix <em>-able</em> or <em>-ible</em> are formed from transitive verbs so as to modify what would be their direct objects, as <em>readable</em> modifies what one might read; but this is no invariable rule, since <em>laughable</em> modifies what one might laugh <em>at.</em> So the intransitivity of this sense of <em>relate</em> is not a valid objection.</p>\n\n<p>The Google Books Ngram utility suggests that <em>relatable</em> peaked in the seventies (though it cannot well distinguish usages with a \"to s.t.\" from those without, the latter only being in question here). And indeed these usages of both <em>relate</em> and <em>relatable</em> strike me as redolent of that era's youth culture or counterculture; they seem to function primarily as a kind of slang, i.e., to identify the user as a member of that culture, hipper than those who might use <em>understand</em> and <em>understandable</em> for the same purposes. If that is all that is going on, such usages are generally ill-suited to formal academic writing.
