It's more than that, as I actually considered poetry one of my strong suits. </p>\n\n<p>What is the word capturing this emotion?  My best guess would be crestfallen, however this can only be used as a past tense \"adjective verb\" (I'm not sure that is the proper term, so if I'm wrong please tell me). </p>\n\n<p>Is there a word that I could use in the present tense?
