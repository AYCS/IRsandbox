Occasionally, we might go to a bar first but we don't really hang out socially at all beyond that.  Currently, we are both making an effort to expand on the relationship to include other activities.  </p>\n\n<p>Texting:</p>\n\n<pre><code>me:   do you want to do whatever tonight...?\nhim:  define whatever. lol. \nme:   google says... whatever -&gt; pronoun &amp; determiner: used to emphasize a lack of\n      restriction in referring to any thing or amount, no matter what.\nme:   I guess I could have chosen \"something\" instead, which would have also implied \n      that I do not prefer the nothing possibility included in the scope of \n      whatever \nhim:  so... just to clarify... candyflipping at a rave is out?\nme:   ummmmmmm... technically, based on what i said at least, it is still in.  but no, \n      we should not do that.  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then we debated my word choice.  (yes, I'm lots of fun...) </p>\n\n<p>So, here's my argument for using <code>whatever</code> over <code>something</code>... The idea of <code>something</code>  essentially means \"not nothing\" or \"more than nothing\".  However, <code>whatever</code> does include both \"nothing\" and \"anything\"... and in that, <code>nothing</code> can be expanded towards \"nothing together\" and \"nothing apart\".  By saying <code>something</code>, the <code>nothing</code> is entirely removed (except, of course, if he says no to the question as a whole and turns me down tonight).  I chose <code>whatever</code> because I feel like the question in itself removes the absolute <code>nothing</code> from <code>whatever</code>.  Also, I did not want to exclude our normal \"nothing out in the world but alone in your room together\" activity and using <code>something</code> might appear like I am asking for something other/more than that tonight.  </p>\n\n<p>What I wanted to say:  I am good with anything together.  I do not specifically have something else to suggest for tonight but if he has something he wants to do with me, I am willing to go with him.  I am happy with what we normally do together.  I also understand if he is busy but I would prefer to meet up.  I think <code>whatever</code> was the better choice.  </p>\n\n<p>What he said: the words are the same and using <code>whatever</code> makes me sound like I am 12 years old.   </p>\n"},{"id":106399,"title":"&quot;Put/value above&quot; vs. &quot;put/value over&quot;","body":"<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The company puts profits <strong>above/over</strong> safety.  </li>\n  <li>The company values profits <strong>above/over</strong> safety.  </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it <em>above</em> or <em>over</em>?</p>\n"},{"id":103760,"title":"“On the lake” vs. “in the lake”","body":"<p>Which of the following sentences makes sense?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>We took the new kayak out <strong>on</strong> the lake as it was a nice day.</li>\n  <li>We took the new kayak out <strong>in</strong> the lake as it was a nice day.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":89749,"title":"Over or under half price","body":"<p>If something normally cost £300 and someone is selling exactly the same item for £100, is this:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>over half price   </li>\n  <li>under half price  </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does it depend on context or is either correct?</p>\n\n<p>For example, if I were in marketing, and had this as a deal, which would be the correct choice?</p>\n"},{"id":76024,"title":"&quot;Communicate over&quot; vs. &quot;communicate through&quot;","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Also schemas can communicate <em>over</em> database links to schemas in other remote databases. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Could one replace the preposition <em>over</em> with <em>through</em>?<br>\nWill it change the meaning, and if so, when should we use <em>over</em> instead of <em>through</em>?</p>\n"},{"id":11660,"title":"&quot;The powers above&quot;","body":"<p>I found the following comment left in a website:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There was an offer to merge, but the API was completely different and I gave up with the negative feedback.
