Today I was speaking to another first language English speaker (Canadian) and used the word \"accessory\" but the other person did not understand me. I changed the stress from the first syllable to the second and they finally understood. I thought this was because my English is more Americanized, and chalked it up to the difference with Canadian English. Curious, I looked up the pronunciation in the dictionary but it only offered the second syllable stress pronunciation as correct.</p>\n\n<p>Have I been pronouncing it wrong all this time? I only use the first syllable stress version when talking about objects (an accessory for a camera, for example) but for some reason use the second syllable stress version in other situations (like \"accessory to murder\"). I cannot trace why I pronounce it the first way, so I have no idea where I learned to pronounce it that way (or why the other way in other contexts).

The stress in Greek is on the penult, but there's a short /o/ in the penultimate syllable, so I'd expect a Latinized pronunciation of /uˈroboros/ according to the <a href=\"http://www.slu.edu/colleges/AS/languages/classical/latin/tchmat/grammar/g-accnt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Latin stress assignment rule</a>, and I'd also expect for the Latin stress position to carry over to the English word, especially when the initial vowel uses the value /jʊə/ associated with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_English_pronunciation_of_Latin#Open_u\" rel=\"nofollow\">traditional English pronunciation of Latin /u/</a>. Compare to \"automaton,\" another example of a Greek word with a short vowel in the penult that is stressed on the antepenult in English.</p>\n\n<p>But, I've <strong>never</strong> seen this pronunciation listed. Dictionaries do list pronunciations with antepenult accent, and pronunciations with initial /j/, but none I can find list a pronunciation with both of these features combined.</p>\n\n<p>So, if I use it, am I just adding my own idiosyncratic pronunciation to the mix, no better and no worse than the other variants? Or is there some flaw in the analogy I made above that makes /jʊəˈrɒbɔrəs/ a solecism, but that justifies /jʊərɵˈbɒrəs/ (or /ɔːˈrɒbɔrəs/, etc.) ?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_English_pronunciation_of_Latin#Stress\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia says about stress in Latinate English words</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In words of three or more syllables, stress falls either on the penult or the antepenult (third from the end), according to these criteria:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>If the penult contains a short vowel in an open syllable, the stress falls on the antepenult</strong>: e.g. stá.mi.na, hy.pó.the.sis. </li>\n  <li>If the penult contains a long vowel; a diphthong; a closed syllable (with any length of vowel); or is followed by z, the stress falls on the penult.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>[...]\n  The fact that decorum is stressed on the penult, and exodus on the\n  antepenult, is a fact about each of these words that must be memorized\n  separately (unless one is already familiar with the Classical\n  quantities, and in the former case, additionally with the fact that\n  decus -ŏris n. with short -o- syllable became in late Latin\n  decus/decor -ōris m. with long -o- syllable: 'Dómine, diléxi decórem\n  domus tuæ').</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if the pronunciation of \"uroboros\" might be explained in the same way as that of \"decorum,\" where the vowel length/stress shifted at some point in Latin?
