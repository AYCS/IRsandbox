It was donated by Yamaki as a part of a 53-specimen gift to the United States for its 1976 bicentennial.</p>\n\n<p>The job to ensure the continued survival of such an important piece of the collection falls onto the shoulders of Jack Sustic, the curator of the Bonsai and Penjing Museum since 2002.</p>\n\n<p>He says:\n“One of the things that makes it so special is, if you imagine, somebody has attended to that tree every day since 1625.

However, it doesn’t help me at all when I try to imagine the sound.

They make <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9i3Hit-7Lk\" rel=\"nofollow\">a tut-tut-tut like noise</a>, using their tongue. So I wanted to know if the chirruping noise is different from that. From your explanations, English speaking people seems to have no united way to call a cat. (I didn’t know that!). I guess the chirruping noise in this scene might depend on audience’s imagination.</p>\n\n<p>However, I still would like to know a chirruping noise which a man makes toward a horse, because some dictionaries define the meaning by referring to a horse. I’m thinking the definition might make people imagine almost the same sound.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>\nThe second reason to ask this question is my mother tongue has a wide variety of onomatopoeia. If I can get a clear idea of the sound, then I can link the noise to some onomatopoeia in my mind, and I can get a clearer image from that.</p>\n"},{"id":29914,"title":"Is there any nuance in ‘I was kind’ when it means ‘I treated her kindly”?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>\"But I was patient.
