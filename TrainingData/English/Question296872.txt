[{"id":296872,"title":"Who first objected to the term &quot;chain mail&quot;?","body":"<p>Recently, I've become aware of a new (to me) peeve: some people say that \"chain mail/chain-mail/chainmail\" is incorrect in some way when talking about armor, and that the proper way to refer to it is \"mail\" or \"maille.\"* Now, it's true that it's not exactly composed of chains, although loops of mail are closer to being a chain than a \"chain link fence\" is. But anyway, the point of this question is not to ask for an evaluation of this peeve, or your opinion of it. What I want to know is if all these people independently came to the conclusion that the term was illogical, or if they absorbed this idea from some common source.</p>\n\n<p>The term \"chain mail\" has been around for a while. The OED's earliest citation is from 1822; using Google Books, I was able to find what seem to be even earlier examples:</p>\n\n<p>1789:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Haubergeon was a coat compoſed either of plate or <strong>chain-mail</strong>\n  without ſleeves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>– <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=EgEHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=%22chain%20mail%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPyL2Xh_nJAhUH9GMKHa2MAUA4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22chain%20mail%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Letters, Written During the Reigns of Henry VI, Edward IV and Richard III.</em></a>, edited by Sir John Fenn</p>\n\n<p>1796:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The hauberk was a complete covering of double <strong>chain mail</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>– <em><a href=\"http://Fabliaux%20Or%20Tales,%20Abridged%20from%20French%20Manuscripts%20of%20the%20XIIth\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabliaux Or Tales, Abridged from French Manuscripts of the XIIth and\nXIIIth Centuries</a></em> by M.
