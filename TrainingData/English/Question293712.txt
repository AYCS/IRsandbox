In the past, whenever it came to something related to the future, I would use 'will'. Now in the USA, people use 'would' a lot. For example, if we are talking about MIT, some guy may say 'I would go to MIT someday'. For me, I prefer to say 'I will go to MIT someday and I will surely make it!' There are many similar examples.  I know grammatically both sentences must be correct but I just can't understand the usage of 'would' here.</p>\n\n<p>I have looked up some information online. They helped a lot. For example, people say'would' can be used to express your desire or hope. However, from my memory of middle school, it is 'will' that could be used to express your willingness to do something. </p>\n\n<p>According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, both words can be used to express a desire or wish.
