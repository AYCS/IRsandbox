However, in my estimation the subject of a sentence will remain so no matter where it's placed within the sentence; thus, \"tomorrow\" cannot be the subject but rather \"anniversary\" is which led me to use the options I listed above.

Basically, I'm having a crisis of what sounds good to the ear and is standard versus what can\n  sound incorrect/complex/clumsy to the ear but still be viewed as\n  grammatically viable. Yes, adding a verb to describe what the couple\n  would do on their anniversary and/or replacing \"me and my girlfriend\"\n  with a standard possessive adjective \"our\" would easily solve the\n  issue. But I guess my question was more about how irritatingly close\n  can a speaker get to \"bad grammar\" or \"broken English\" without it\n  being so? That's why I tried to use the OA's words at my disposal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":254546,"title":"What is the correct way to request one item each from more than one source?","body":"<p>I'd like a single screenshot each from two dashboards.
