What particularly amazed me there is how many people can't comprehend spoken English. DA asks questions in a very slow, clear, monotonous voice without any emotion, and questions are all grammatically correct. He obviously does this as a job for years. Yet, about half of the witnesses, one after another just don't understand his questions. They kept asking \"Can you repeat the question?\" And I could see the struggling expression on their face. Most witnesses were in 20-25 age range, all studied in the US high schools, and most have BA degrees of some kind.</p>\n\n<p>The factor that triggered this, I think, is that questions were a bit more complex than usual, for example: <em>When was the first time you met the defendant or anybody related to him in any way?</em></p>\n\n<p>I didn't even go to English language high school, my school was in completely different language, and while seating in the last row in the audience, I still understood every single question, and I think almost every nuance of every question.</p>\n\n<p>My question is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there an English word describing a person who can't comprehend the correct and clearly audible speech?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I can only wonder how much would they be able to comprehend when somebody would speak very fast and not very clearly.</p>\n"},{"id":276325,"title":"A word or expression for people who have lived at the same time at least during one day?","body":"<p>Is there a word or expression for people who have lived at the same time, even if other was only during one day?
