[{"id":199691,"title":"Use of apostrophe in adjective phrase containing a possessive","body":"<p>I work and write for a tech company that has created many first-in-the-world technologies. In press releases, I often write something like “[Company name] today announced another world’s first with the development of [new technology].” My question has to do with talking about these technologies collectively, as in a sentence like: “These world’s first technologies have made [company name] a leader in the industry.”</p>\n\n<p>When “world’s first” is used as an adjective phrase, are there any rules dictating the use of the apostrophe? Should it be “world’s first technologies” or “world-first technologies”?</p>\n\n<p>An acquaintance believes “world-first technologies” is correct, but that just doesn’t sound right to me. I didn’t find anything that addresses this particular (admittedly persnickety) quandary in my Chicago Manual of Style (15th edition) or online.
