Today I was speaking to another first language English speaker (Canadian) and used the word \"accessory\" but the other person did not understand me. I changed the stress from the first syllable to the second and they finally understood. I thought this was because my English is more Americanized, and chalked it up to the difference with Canadian English. Curious, I looked up the pronunciation in the dictionary but it only offered the second syllable stress pronunciation as correct.</p>\n\n<p>Have I been pronouncing it wrong all this time? I only use the first syllable stress version when talking about objects (an accessory for a camera, for example) but for some reason use the second syllable stress version in other situations (like \"accessory to murder\"). I cannot trace why I pronounce it the first way, so I have no idea where I learned to pronounce it that way (or why the other way in other contexts).
