The last time I spent time mastering a recording was well over a month ago. Before, I had no idea how to use an equalizer - I looked up a bunch of videos and tutorials, but after a few hours stopped trying because it was taking too long to figure out.</p>\n\n<p>When I went to master the song today, I just started flying through the equalization process for each track like I had been doing it for years (and the quality of the sound was improved, so I must have been doing <em>something</em> right). I have no clue how I 'just knew' what to do, considering that I've never actually done anything like it before, with the exception of the 3 hours I spent on it a month ago.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a word or expression for suddenly knowing how to do what you didn't before? Presumably, some amount of time has passed between the first attempt and subsequent attempts.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to gaining insight into a problem after sleeping on it, but with a practicable <em>skill</em>.</p>\n"},{"id":288771,"title":"the sunlight that streams into a room through the window","body":"<p>Is there a word for \"the sunlight that streams into a room through the window, or a crack in the curtain or through a skylight\" </p>\n"},{"id":33608,"title":"Is there a generic word in English that means &quot;through time&quot;?","body":"<p>I know \"temporal\" means \"to do with time\", but I'm looking specifically for a term that means \"spanning time\" or \"over time\". Not necessarily <em>all</em> time, as \"eternal\" would mean, nor do I want to necessarily imply anything about the span of time (e.g. being long or short).</p>\n\n<p>Upon reflection, I guess \"temporally\" is actually the closest word to use. I was just hoping for a word that meant literally \"spans time\". I guess the implication of using the word \"temporally\", because it deals with time, also often implies over the course of time.</p>\n\n<p>However to illustrate the difference, I could use the term \"temporal locality\" to mean things that are close together in time (a term we use in Computer Science). In this case, \"temporal\" refers specifically to the concept of time, not the concept of something spanning it (it generally refers to two points in time that are close together, and points in time do not \"span\" time).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here's a much better example, though it's specific to programming: let's suppose we deal with the concept of locking an object. We might say that an object is \"temporally locked\" which means that it is locked with respect to a certain time; but we might also want to say that it is locked <em>through</em> time. I'd like to be able to say the latter with an adverb such as \"it is locked <code>_____</code>\". Since temporally locked already means something else, we need a distinction.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly don't know if such a word exists, and it's more out of curiosity than anything, but thanks to all the folks who have contributed ideas. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I've thought of another way to formulate my request. Think of it perhaps as the opposite of a specific point in time. In other words, a word that means <strong>\"not restricted to a particular point in time\"</strong>. I think perhaps that's a better example than my lock example above.</p>\n\n<p>I like the word <em>chronological</em> for this reason, but chronological also implies the concept of order and specifically <em>progression</em> through time, which isn't really part of this concept. <em>Indefinite</em> also works, to a degree, but as the term doesn't involve time itself, it would have to be <em>temporally indefinite</em>. This is very close, but again, a single word would be awesome.</p>\n"},{"id":137882,"title":"Is there a word for the practice of fobbing off additional unwanted software on the downloaders of your free product?","body":"<p>Free software providers, including such giants as Adobe or Dell, will often try to make the downloaders download more than they are trying to download.
