And of course that taboo alone may explain what seems to be a sort of language gap. </p>\n\n<p>But sometimes taboo doesn't mean there isn't a term for something, it just means a term may be hidden or buried (I'm sorry I can't think of examples off the top of my head but I remember learning about that for my English degree).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is the shift between Saxon and Norman English when we ended up with a split for 'living animal' (cow, sheep, deer) and 'dead food-meat animal' (beef, mutton, venison). </p>\n\n<p>But that does serve as a handy dividing line - on this side are the words for live creature, and on that side are the words for food. </p>\n\n<p>If you line up 'cow, sheep, deer, pig' on one side of that line, you have 'food' words to put on the other. For 'human' or 'person' however, you don't. </p>\n\n<p>Again, I know there are historical reasons, but I'm not wondering about the taboo, I'm wondering if there ever has been a word for this? </p>\n\n<p>There is the word 'flesh' and it kind of implies 'non-specific meat.' As in 'deer flesh' or 'cow flesh.' Although it has quasi-religious connotations as in 'flesh of my flesh' and 'take of my flesh and eat it.' </p>\n\n<p>Maybe 'flesh' alone is the word, considering the religious usage in the symbolism of communion? </p>\n\n<p>But is there something more specific for those unsettling times when humans may have had nothing else to eat but other humans for survival - à la the Donner party. This has happened throughout time so is there a hidden word in English or historical languages related to English for human as food meat? </p>\n\n<p>Again, I'm not trying to be grim or unsettling. I've seriously wondered about this for several years.  </p>\n"},{"id":262521,"title":"Is there a term for ascribing acts of the human mind to non-human objects, and when is it appropriate to do this?","body":"<p><em>Nota bene</em>: English isn't my native language, so when I say <em>acts of the human mind</em>, I attempt to generalize things such as making assumptions, drawing conclusions and (to some extent) to reject.</p>\n\n<p>To me it seems this isn't identical to <em>anthropomorphism</em>, but close to it, or a subset of it. In the Swedish Wikipedia article on anthropomorphism they make a distinction between an entity <em>looking like</em> a human being (\"physical anthropomorphism\") and having a \"human-like spiritual life\" (\"psychological anthropomorphism\"). The latter comes even closer, but to me, it still isn't quite there because of the ambiguity in the notion of someone or something having a \"spiritual life\".</p>\n\n<p>An example: in one of my school courses, students were criticized by the teacher for including statements such as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ultimately, our article draws the conclusion that X and Y is Z.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>in their articles; the error being that such a statement communicates that the article itself is capable of drawing conclusions <em>as if it were human</em>, or otherwise capable of thinking and reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>Another example: sometimes when writing computer programs, I write things like</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the function assumes that the argument <strong>n</strong> is an integer</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>in the comments; with this I'm implying (to myself, at any rate!) that if you call the function with a value for <strong>n</strong> that is anything but an integer, any return values are \"bogus\" and/or the program stops working correctly. But can a function assume things? In my opinion, <em>not really</em>. On a different note, if anyone else needs to read my code, I'd have to at least further specify what happens when <strong>n</strong> isn't an integer, but more importantly (to the subject at hand) choose a more proper wording than \"the function assumes this and that\".</p>\n\n<p>The Swedish noun <em>själsliv</em> (a compound of <em>själ</em> and <em>liv</em>) used in the aforementioned Wikipedia article translates to \"spiritual life\" according to Google Translate, but a more literal translation is \"soul-life\", or <em>perhaps</em> \"mind-life\", and with the latter I think it's reasonable to call this \"psychological anthropomorphism\".</p>\n\n<p>I notice there's some overlap with <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/68798/can-a-non-human-reason-in-the-sense-of-inferring\">Can a non-human “reason” in the sense of inferring</a>. One of the examples from that question entry is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The folk singer's soothing music breathed peacefulness into the cafe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, the music itself can't breathe, obviously, but few English speakers would <em>not</em> interpret this as a metaphor. But when it comes to functions and articles assuming things or drawing conclusions, is it ever \"OK\", even in an informal sense?</p>\n"},{"id":237213,"title":"Usage of the noun &#39;news&#39;","body":"<p>I would like to ask you a question concerning the noun 'news'. I am aware that as an uncountable noun,  it is, thus, not possible to use the indefinite article preceding it.

I would use it to express that I can not grasp why some piece of news is occupying space in the media, but I've never heard anyone using it in a similar context.

Two people are debating, and one says \"the difference between your position and mine is just a matter of semantics.\"   This would seem to me to be quite an important difference.  That is, if one person means one thing, and the other person means something else, then they really do have different positions.</p>\n\n<p>If they said \"it is just a matter of terminology\" or \"just a matter of phrasing\" I would get it.

I guess it seems that there is a popular notion that semantics is about very fine distinctions, such as: <a href=\"http://www.democraticunderground.com/?com=view_post&amp;forum=1018&amp;pid=160186\">I think it's just a matter of semantics, not so much a difference per se</a></p>\n\n<p>Another interpretation seems to be that semantics is the difference between two ways of saying the same thing: <a href=\"http://www.marvinmarshall.com/class-creates-rules/\">I usually involve the students in the creation of classroom rules.  To me, we are just agreeing upon how we can make our classroom a safe and fun place to be. I don’t know if it’s really so different from a DWS approach of having procedures, but “no rules.”  Isn’t this just a matter of semantics?</a></p>\n\n<p>Maybe it is just a way of stopping an annoying conversation: <a href=\"http://secularhumanist.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-matter-of-semantics-words-concepts.html\">In ordinary conversations, when people debate a point and the words they are using for discussion they often backhand this disagreement with the phrase “It’s a matter of semantics.” </a></p>\n\n<p>And then there is some usage that I simply don't understand:  <a href=\"http://www.robbinswritings.com/blog/2011/2/21/is-your-message-just-a-matter-of-semantics.html\">I recently spoke at a mens' event in which one of the participants asked me if having a good and noble heart was just a matter of semantics. -- In other words, does it really matter?</a></p>\n\n<p>And also: <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201102240593.html\">The Argument for and against the 6-3-3-4 system of education has raged on as stakeholders give conflicting position on whether it stays or not  ....  the 6-3-3-4 policy is just a matter of semantics, the government cannot take decisions without due consultations.</a></p>\n\n<p>Still, to me it is just a meaningless phrase.
