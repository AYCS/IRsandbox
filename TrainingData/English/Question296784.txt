[{"id":296784,"title":"English word for Norwegian &quot;skaresn&#248;&quot; - snow with a hard crust","body":"<p>Is there an English word for what Norwegians call \"skaresnø\" ('skare'-snow) - or just \"skare\"?</p>\n\n<p>It's the hard crust/lid you get on top of snow, where the top layer has started to melt a bit before freezing again - often due to the sun shining on the snow all day or temperatures just above freezing.  It's not ice - it's still snow - but it's been bound together when freezing.</p>\n\n<p>If the crust is strong enough, you can ski - or even walk - across it without sinking into the snow underneath.  Of course, there's always a danger that the \"skare\" isn't quite strong enough to bear you...</p>\n\n<p>We also talk about \"skareføre\" - where \"føre\" is more about the <em>condition</em> of the surface we want to move across... here it's snow, but it's also used for road condition.  \"isføre\" (icy conditions) implies you'll have to be careful when driving and walking... \"klisterføre\" (\"sticky\"-condition refers to a type ski wax used for snow above freezing - which is rather sticky itself)... and \"skareføre\" implies that the \"skaresnow\" is at least strong enough to ski across - if not also to walk across.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":289218,"title":"A single word for &quot;hard to pronounce&quot;","body":"<p>Is there a single word which means \"hard to pronounce\" ?<br>\nFor example <em>Dijkstra</em> is \"hard to pronounce\".</p>\n"},{"id":285003,"title":"A single word for &quot;stuck between a rock and a hard place&quot;","body":"<p><a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/q/32785/102076\">expression &quot;caught between a rock and a hard place&quot;</a> describes the meaning and origins.
