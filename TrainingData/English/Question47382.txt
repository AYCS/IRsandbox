The reason I am asking is that I saw a movie where the guy said \"I promise not [pause] to kill X\" and then he asked someone else to do it for him, thus violating the spirit of his promise (i.e. he wouldn't have X killed), but not the letter because he didn't actually do it himself. My impression, while I was watching the movie, was that the pause was deliberate, the guy was actually trying to hide a lie in his promise. This behaviour is not unheard of: in Ancient Greece oracles would pronounce obscure prophecies such that whatever happened the oracle would have been seen as having guessed. My question is about the grammatical structure of a sentence starting with \"I promise not to\" and the <em>possibility</em> to use it, consciously, to hide one's intentions.</p>\n"},{"id":111540,"title":"What is “long” doing in “all (time-period) long”?","body":"<p>What part of speech is <strong><em>long</em></strong> playing the part of in the bold parts of the quotations below?  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For one thing, it shows at a glance how much money is on hand for any particular  purpose <strong>all month long</strong>. </li>\n<li>The fishermen stayed in their nets <strong>the whole night long</strong>.</li>\n<li>Some people prefer to live in places that have the same weather  or climate <strong>all year long</strong>.</li>\n<li>He had told them to sit on the edge of the sandbox <strong>all recess long</strong> and not move  a finger.</li>\n<li>Wild animals, driven by hunger, came <strong>all winter long</strong> to live close to the feeding  station.</li>\n<li>Other friends worked hard <strong>all semester long</strong> and didn't feel any pressure at all as  the final exam approached.  </li>\n<li>One half of the labor actually expended in the cultivation of these grapes would  have kept them in tip-top order <strong>the whole season long</strong> if they had been planted in  four rows as already suggested rather than in twenty short ones.</li>\n<li>It suddenly came to him that he would never, <strong>his whole life long</strong>, see Gramps  again. </li>\n<li>He did such good work, and so much, that nobody would question him.

I think.</p>\n\n<p>How should this sort of construction best be classified? The OED calls <strong><em>long</em></strong> an adverb here.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Edit</h1>\n\n<p>My confusion may be that I’m unclear about the transition from something being a modifier that takes a complement and it becoming an actual preposition/postposition/adposition. </p>\n\n<p>I am not referring to <strong><em>long</em></strong> used as an adverb in such collocations as “How long have you been here?” or “as long as you like”.  Rather, I mean what the OED gives as its sense 6 of <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109979\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong><em>long</em></strong><sup>1</sup> <em>adv.</em></a> the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>6</strong>. Subjoined to expressions designating a period of time, with the sense: Throughout the length of (the period specified).  [Compare German <em>sein leben lang</em>.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s been used this way at least since Middle English; the first citation given is for “all year long” from back around 1290 ᴀᴅ in the <em>South English Legendary</em> (a source that provides <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/source/w111\" rel=\"nofollow\">2359 quotations</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><i>c</i>1290      <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/source/w111\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>S.

However, it is similar to <a href=\"http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4080\" rel=\"nofollow\">the entry for  <strong><em>ago</em></strong> <em>adj</em>. and <em>adv</em></a>, which has indeed been updated for the <em>OED3</em>, and which remains an adverb when used in phrases like “long ago” and “longer ago”, but which it classifies as an adjective when used in the more customary collocation of time, as with this recent citation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>2009      S. Craven <em>Ruthless Awakening</em> 32  <br> We agreed on the guest lists ages ago.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There appears to be some dispute about whether things like <strong><em>ago</em></strong> constitute <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_prepositions#Postpositions\" rel=\"nofollow\">actual instances of “postpositions” in English</a>, or whether they are better left in their traditional categories of adjectival or adverbial modifiers that just happen to follow their modificand. </p>\n\n<p>I am confortable with saying that <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/75510\">nouns like <em>home</em> or <em>Tuesday</em> can be used adverbially</a>, as in “I’m going home” or “I’ll see you Tuesday”, but this doesn’t quite seem like one of those to me.  On the other hand, it does remind me of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I stayed through the whole night.</li>\n<li>I stayed the whole  night through.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the first is to be called a preposition, but the second is not to be called a postposition, then we have to call <em>through</em> an adjective “modifying” <em>night</em> and the entire thing somehow a noun phrase being used adverbially.  That seems to be the very sort of classificational contortion as is being attempted with calling <strong><em>long</em></strong> an adjective, and I find both to be particularly unsatisfying approaches.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>SUMMARY</h1>\n\n<p>A clearer explanation of what <strong><em>long</em></strong> is and is not in the type of collocations presented in the initial example list would be  much appreciated.
