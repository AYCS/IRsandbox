(I realize that AP style and the Chicago Manual of Style differ on the length of words affected, but I'm going with the \"four or fewer letters\" standard.)  For the most part, following this guideline is fairly straightforward.  However there are certain rarely used prepositions (or words that rarely function as prepositions), which in practice I almost always see capitalized even though they should (in theory anyway) be written lowercase.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially true of \"down\" which always seems to be capitalized, even in publications and on websites (like Wikipedia) that normally don't capitalize prepositions of four or fewer letters.  I'm not sure if this is a commonly accepted practice (like the way \"as\" is frequently written lowercase even when functioning as a subordinating conjunction) or if it's just a result of confusion because \"down\" is so rarely used as a preposition.  There are a few other words which I sporadically see written lowercase, though not consistently.</p>\n\n<p>I've listed a few examples below.  All spellings are taken from Wikipedia.
