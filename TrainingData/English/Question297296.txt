I thought that phrase only has negative meaning( like true to urself. behave your true self,  etc.. I can not find any positive meaning about this phrase),  so I am wondering does he just tell me to relax and chill( be a REAL human and do not push myself unrealistic hard, because I started work from 8:30AM to now) or this is a ironic joke( like he does not believe I am working but just wasting time pretending working)?</p>\n\n<p>Since He said that directly to me, so this makes me so confused! Im still learning English, and I do not make any misunderstanding to anyone or by anyone, please help. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"id":227265,"title":"Is &#39;dicing&#39; a verb in dice games?","body":"<p>When you're playing Yahtzee or any other dice game, is it correct to use the verb \"dicing\" when you want to notify whoever is listening? Or is \"dicing\" a slang word ? Or is it neither? Could it be my not-native-English-speaking fantasy that I may just imagine whatever seems like a possibility?</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it seems like the English-speaking people I played with did understand it, so it might be a real word, or just as likely it could be that I like to play with words.  Maybe I should keep that to words in Swedish, my native language. ðŸ˜®</p>\n"},{"id":234750,"title":"How do you classify words like &#39;Helllloooo&#39;, &#39;Hiyyyaaa&#39;, and &#39;whoooooo&#39; used frequently in Twitter?","body":"<p>When looking at many Tweets you can find many 'elaborations' on words, eg. hi > hiiiii, hello > helllloooooo, down > downnnnn. They are not exactly slang in my own opinion, maybe they are but of a different type. It seems like they are trying to convey an emphasis change or draw more attention. Also, they are not completely new words and don't look like they might become either. Have such modifications been categorized? Is there a name to identify such usages of normal words? From what I know I have only seen them being used in Twitter.</p>\n"},{"id":231170,"title":"What does &#39; you can do me every day&#39; mean?","body":"<p>If a girl is talking to a guy that she says she doesnt trust very much,  and the guy says </p>\n\n<p>'you can do me every day ...

It could be something like \"Xbox prices are going to go up\", but they never do.
