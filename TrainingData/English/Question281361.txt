More often than not I took it as a word for <em>official ban</em> or <em>penalty</em>.. until recently when I was watching an interview in which the interviewee felt offended over a question asked by someone in the audience and refused to answer it and said \"she do not sanction impoliteness\"...contextually meaning <em>approval</em> or <em>consent</em>. \nWhen I googled its meaning, it offered me two usages :-</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>a threatened penalty for disobeying a law or rule; <em>syn</em>- <em>penalty, ban, deterrent</em>, <em>correction</em></p></li>\n<li><p>official permission or approval for an action; <em>syn</em>- <em>permission ,authority, agreement</em></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Both of them are almost contradictory and do not offer an unambiguous understanding when used in  sentence.</p>\n\n<p>For example: <em>the court sanctioned the proposal</em>. \nDid the court approved or deterred?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":287257,"title":"What does &quot;fail successfully&quot; mean?","body":"<p>From reading the words it sounds like teaching someone how to fail, however I hear people use it to motivate others to succeed!.

When I first read this, I didn't see the “insult”, unless it's sheer irony, I still don't see it.
