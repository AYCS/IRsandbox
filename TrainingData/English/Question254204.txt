I had copied the examples exactly as they appeared in the papers before correcting them. But it is exactly some of these errors that could give an idea on how people misunderstand the usage of \"there is/was\" and what makes it hard to explain what is the correct usage. For example, sentence 3 can be changed to: 1. There were four types of behavior, which were prepared as follows, or 2. Four types of behavior were prepared as follows. But I couldn't come up with an easy to understand explanation why this is so. I think Jim's answer gives a simple way to explain the usage to my colleagues. So @Jim, thank you!

Police <em>cracks</em> down on IAC protesters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have found instances of <code>police cracks</code> in newspapers: <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/372949/20120813/baba-ramdev-protest-arrested-delhi-police-parliament.htm\">\"Police cracks whip\"</a> and <a href=\"http://chesterfield.patch.com/articles/chesterfield-police-cracks-down-on-drunk-drivers\">\"Chesterfield police cracks down on drunk drivers\"</a>. However, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Police%20crack,%20police%20crack,%20Police%20cracks,%20police%20cracks&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3\">google's ngram viewer</a> suggests that <code>police cracks</code> is significantly less frequent:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yfi3C.png\" alt=\"Ngram frequency of &lt;code&gt;police crack&lt;/code&gt; and others\"></p>\n\n<p>I think that the difference between <code>Police _crack_ down</code> and <code>Police _cracks_ down</code> is influenced by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_%28linguistics%29\">subject-verb agreement</a> and that the difference in this example reflects the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number\">grammatical number</a> of the verb's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_%28grammar%29\">subject</a>. Here, <code>cracks</code> is inflected for singular number, which implies that its subject is singular, and <code>crack</code> is inflected for plural number, which implies that its subject is plural. E.g.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The army cracks down on IAC protesters. <em>[singular]</em></p>\n  \n  <p>The armies crack down on IAC protesters. <em>[plural]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The confusing thing about (1) and (2) is that the subject, <code>police</code>, looks like it is singular; the plural form would be <code>polices</code>, but I have never heard this form (for the noun).</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like <code>police</code> fits the definition of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun\">collective noun</a>, which Wikipedia says is \"the name of a number (or collection) of people or things taken together and spoken of as one whole. For example, in the phrase 'a pride of lions', pride is a collective noun.\" <code>Police</code> fits this because it refers to (i) some relevant police force or (ii) some relevant group of police officers, which are both collections of people taken as wholes. It does <em>not</em> refer to a single police officer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So one might conjecture that verbs whose subjects are collective nouns are inflected for plural number.</strong> However, it sounds like <code>group</code> also fits the definition of a collective noun because it refers to a collection of individuals taken as a whole. And I think that both of the following sound acceptable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(3) The group crack down on IAC protesters.</p>\n  \n  <p>(4) The group cracks down on IAC protesters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above conjecture also doesn't explain why it is sometimes okay to use <code>police cracks</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My preliminary questions:</strong> Do (1), (2), (3) and (4) all sound acceptable to everyone else? Are <code>police</code> and <code>group</code> both collective nouns? </p>\n\n<p><strong>My main questions:</strong> If (3) and (4) are both acceptable and <code>police</code> and <code>group</code> are both collective nouns, then why does (1) <em>but not (2)</em> sound acceptable, or at least why is <code>police crack</code> better than <code>police cracks</code>? How do you determine the correct conjugation for a verb whose subject is a collective noun? Is there a general rule, or does it vary from case to case?</p>\n\n<p><strong>My secondary questions:</strong> Does the behavior of (1) and (2) have to do with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesis\">synesis</a>? Is using <code>police</code> to refer to the police force more like a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche\">synecdoche</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech#Tropes\">other kind of rhetorical trope</a>?
