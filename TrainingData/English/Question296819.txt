Every year Elkanah would offer a sacrifice at the Shiloh sanctuary, and give Penninah and her children a portion but he gave Hannah a double portion \"because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb\" (NIV). One day Hannah went up to the temple, and prayed with great weeping (I Samuel 1:10), while Eli the High Priest was sitting on a chair near the doorpost. In her prayer she asked God for a son and in return she vowed to give the son back to God for the service of the Shiloh priests. She promised he would remain a Nazarite all the days of his life.</p>\n  \n  <p>Eli thought she was drunk and questioned her. When she explained herself, he sent her away and effectively said that her prayer would be heard and her desire granted. As promised, she conceived and bore a son. She called his name Samuel, \"since she had asked the Lord for him\" (1 Samuel 1:20 NAB). She raised him until he was weaned and brought him to the temple along with a sacrifice. The first 10 verses of 1 Samuel 2 record her song of praise to the Lord for answering her petition. Eli announced another blessing on Hannah, and she conceived 3 more sons and 2 daughters, making six in total.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":70440,"title":"Is the phrase &quot;make the grade&quot; correctly used in this context?","body":"<p>I was interested in the following sentence which appeared in an article titled “<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/schoolbook/2012/05/09/how-my-child-skipped-the-state-tests\">How My Child Skipped the State Tests</a>\" by Robert Kulesz in The New York Times, School Book, (May 9, 2012).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To be fair, I’m sure she felt\n  she acted in the best interest of her school, given Mayor Michael R.\n  Bloomberg’s insatiable desire to shut down public schools if they fail\n  to “make the grade.” <em>[note that the double quotation marks are of the journalist, NOT MINE]</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can someone clarify if the idiom, or idiomatic phrase, \"make the grade\" is correctly used?</p>\n\n<p>I have found (The Free Dictionary) the below meanings for this phrase, <strong>but no one is referred to academic grading</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p><strong>to be satisfactory; to be what is expected.</strong> <br />I'm sorry, but your work doesn't exactly make the grade.

That\n  drove them to do indoor things: you\n  might say, indoor exploration. It is\n  wonderful how much exploring you can\n  do with a stump of candle in a big\n  house, or in a row of houses.

The dark place was like a\n  long tunnel with brick wall on one\n  side and sloping roof on the other. In\n  the roof there were little chunks of\n  light between the slates. There was no\n  floor in this tunnel: you had to step\n  from rafter to rafter, and between\n  them there was only plaster. If you\n  stepped on this you would find\n  yourself falling through the ceiling\n  of the room below. Polly had used the\n  bit of the tunnel just beside the\n  cistern as a smugglers' cave. She had\n  brought up bits of old packing cases\n  and the seats of broken kitchen\n  chairs, and things of that sort, and\n  spread them across from rafter to\n  rafter so as to make a bit of floor.\n  Here she kept a cash-box containing\n  various treasures, and a story she was\n  writing and usually a few apples. She\n  had often drunk a quiet bottle of\n  ginger-beer in there: the old bottles\n  made it look more like a smugglers'\n  cave.</p>\n  \n  <p>Digory quite liked the cave (she\n  wouldn't let him see the story) but he\n  was more interested in exploring.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Look here,\" he said. \"How long does\n  this tunnel go on for? I mean, does it\n  stop where your house ends?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"No,\" said Polly. \"The walls don't go\n  out to the roof. It goes on.
