[{"id":283977,"title":"What is the distinction between notion and idea","body":"<p>This is my first post ever. I am currently working hard on expending my English vocabulary as well as my spelling abilities.</p>\n\n<p>There is a word that is causing me trouble at this time. The word is <strong>notion</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know what is the distinction between the following words:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>notion,</li>\n<li>idea, </li>\n<li>belief,</li>\n<li>and conception</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some people say notion means a loose concept or a loose idea. I mainly use the Oxford dictionary.Here are some definitions and examples from the oxford dictionary of English.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Origin: Late Middle English: from Latin notio(n-) 'idea', from notus\n  'known', past participle of noscere.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are 3 definition for notion;nevertheless, I am concerned with\n  merely one of them.</p>\n  \n  <p>def1:  (noun) conception of or belief about something: children have\n  different notions about the roles of their parents. <em>I had no notion of\n  what her words meant</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>for the above example, I feel that I could say: \n\nI had no idea of what her words meant.\n\nThe meaning would be the same, right?\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>example 1: <em>Though the concept of beauty is timeless, notions of what\n  constitutes the perfect physical form have changed over time</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>I feel that I don't understand the use of \"notion\" in this sentence.\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>example 2: <em>There are different notions of what public opinion is</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code> This could be replaced with 'idea' or 'belief' or 'conception' right ?\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>example 3: <em>Chinese people seem to have more affection for, and put\n  more belief in, Western notions and practices</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code> This looks like an example I would use. \n I feel that I would have replaced notions with concepts or ideas.\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are definition of the other words I am comparing notions to.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/idea\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/idea</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/belief\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/belief</a></p>\n\n<p>Merriam Webster definition for <strong>conception</strong> is \"an idea or opinion\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>full definition:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>an individual's conception or impression of something known, experienced, or imagined </li>\n  <li>an inclusive general concept </li>\n  <li>a theory or belief held by a person or group</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So opinion and impression is part of the merriam webster's definition.</p>\n\n<p>The contexts in which I will use this word, I think is for everyday talk. I do work a customer service job where I troubleshoot mobile phones. I do want to write sociology and philosophy papers.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":294881,"title":"What is the difference between values and principles?","body":"<p>I am attempting to understand the use of values and principles in organizational communication. </p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Merriam-Webster</a> <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/values\" rel=\"nofollow\">values</a> are defined as</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the amount of money that something is worth</li>\n<li>the price or cost of something something that can be bought for a low or fair price</li>\n<li>usefulness or importance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">principles</a> are defined as</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a moral rule or belief that helps you know what is right and wrong\nand that influences your actions</li>\n<li>a basic truth or theory : an idea that forms the basis of something</li>\n<li>a law or fact of nature that explains how something works or why\nsomething happens</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Blogs such <a href=\"http://brokenmindset.org/principles-vs-values/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BrokenMindSet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.energizedwork.com/weblog/2006/12/values-practices-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">EnergizedWork</a> describe them differently as are the terms when searching online.</p>\n\n<p>For example, these are some of the <a href=\"http://www.cioupdate.com/insights/article.php/3936706/The-4-Principles-of-a-Successful-Data-Strategy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">principles</a> that can be found by searching online</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Operation efficiency</li>\n<li>Retain and grow revenue</li>\n<li>Establish barriers to competition</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are examples of <a href=\"http://www.driveyoursuccess.com/2010/06/how-can-strategic-planning-help-your-business-grow.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">values</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Customer-centric</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>Integrity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How do i use these terms in organizational conversations?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How does one differentiate between principles and values?</li>\n<li>How do you define principles and what would be examples of these?</li>\n<li>How do you define values and what would be examples of these?</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":120295,"title":"What is the difference between desire and motivation?","body":"<p>The words 'desire' and 'motivation' often appear in different kind of sentences for (what I assume is) grammatical reasons, but I have a really hard time separating them as concepts.</p>\n\n<p>When we talk about desire or motivation it seems like we ultimately are talking about why we act; we are seeking some kind of explanation of our actions and without desire or motivation there will be no action. We act because we desire/are motivated by X.... What motivated you / what desires caused you to do that? Do you desire x / are you motivated by x?</p>\n\n<p>It can be a physical (causal) explanation, e.g. the increase in dopamine drove me, it can be a design explanation, e.g. humans are 'designed to' pursue sugar, fat, sex etc, or it can be an intentional explanation, e.g. I work hard because I want money.</p>\n\n<p>It might feel like an explanation is sometimes about desire and sometimes about motivation but are we really talking about any conceptual difference?</p>\n\n<p>Please help me sort this out.</p>\n\n<p>A side point (about MY definition of a value)</p>\n\n<p>I understand that we can value something without being motivated by it. But a value to me is just a type of belief i.e. a belief about what we desire or should desire. Hopefully our values correspond to our desires; our values can influence our desires over time, but believing we value something does not automatically make us act accordingly; we have to make it emotional if we want something to drive us to action i.e. if we want something to motivate us / be a desire.</p>\n\n<p>Wordnet says that desire is \"the feeling that accompanies an unsatisfied state\" or \"an inclination to want things\". The first definition I would say describes a force of motivation i.e. the two words refer to the same phenomenon (the feeling which causes the action), the second definition describe a phenomenon which is either a force for motivation or what I referred to as a value.</p>\n"},{"id":169010,"title":"Distinction between pagan and heathen?","body":"<p>I'm trying to understand the precise distinction between <strong>pagan</strong> and <strong>heathen</strong>.
