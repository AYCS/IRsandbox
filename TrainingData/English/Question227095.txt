In the 16th century -ie is even found in Old English words, eg stonie.  And Mulcaster in his Elementarie of 1582 effectively recommends the dominant use of -ie when he relegates final -y only to \"sharp and loud\" final vowels (eg, deny but prettie).  Why did -ie become so widely used in the 16th century?  Are there phonological reasons to select -ie over -y?  Is it due to contemporary French practices?  I assume it's a complex mix of causes - if so, is there a study into the \"rise and fall\" of -ie?</p>\n"},{"id":261504,"title":"For non-modal/auxiliary verb, is the non-3rd person singular present form always the same as the base form?","body":"<p>The Penn Treebank Parts of Speech tag set differentiated between the base form of verbs (VB), and the non-3rd person singular present form (VBP).</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following cases, with the different uses of rise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>base form:</strong> The share price will rise. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>non-3rd person singular present:</strong> The share prices rise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In both cases the forms are the same.</p>\n\n<p>All the examples I have seen of verbs where that is not true, are with verbs that can be considered (by some definition) to be modal and/or auxiliary.

I am aware of the fact that for second person and third person singular specifically, the verb endings are <em>-est</em> and <em>-eth</em> respectively, but once you move away from simple present tense, it seems to get a bit trickier.</p>\n\n<p>I recall reading somewhere that if you want to make a verb past simple, you add <em>did</em> between the noun and the verb. For example,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He ?<em>dideth walk</em> to the store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As opposed to the modern English,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He <em>walked</em> to the store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And as opposed to how I might say it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He ?<em>walkedeth</em> to the store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I haven’t learned quite as much of English as others may, but I know enough to suspect that “He dideth walk to the store” might be a different tense entirely from “He walkedeth to the store”, at least in modern English.</p>\n\n<p>I am an aspiring and amateur writer, and there is a character that speaks entirely in Early Modern English, and so the answer to this would be quite helpful.</p>\n"},{"id":118962,"title":"-est vs. -st verb endings in Early Modern English","body":"<p>I've been Googling for a little while tonight, but I can't seem to find any rules on this.</p>\n\n<p>Irregular (\"strong\") verbs seem to be pretty set in their endings: goest, dost.
