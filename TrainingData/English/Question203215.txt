Normally, it's a case of the subject not being present in the second clause, as in the following example: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"They usually start out as an abbreviation, but turn into acronyms\n  when they become well known.\"<br>\n  <sub>(taken from the Oxford Style Manual)</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To me, this comma cannot be correct because the clause after the comma doesn't contain a subject and therefore cannot be independent (right?).

I think you intended the comma to indicate a pause, which is grammatically incorrect. In this case, try an en dash (with spaces), an em dash (without spaces), or an ellipsis (with or without spaces). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After consideration, I came to the conclusion that while @Adam is strictly correct, I still preferred this formation, since it does the most to clarify a statement which is subtle and semi-confusing. \n(Any kind of dash breaks up the sentence too much, an ellipsis is just out of place here, and adding a comma at the beginning (after \"Security,\") would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Also, removing the comma altogether just leaves it as more confusing and harder to parse.)</p>\n\n<p>But the more I think about it, it seems to be hindering clarity, at least for @Adam.
