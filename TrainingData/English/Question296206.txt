He is a very hard-worker and works most of the time of a day. He takes a great workload and is always eager to take further workload. His tasks are quantitatively and qualitatively appreciable. He never complains and keeps on discharging the jobs with a smile. I want to devise a catchline, much like what most of the advertisements today use, for him. The catchline I devised is \"... a tireless workaholic\". (I know that \"workaholic\" has a negative shade and is used mainly for those who keep so engrossed in work that they have no time for the other aspects of life. But, I find no better word either. So, I have settled for \"workaholic\". Now, I want to change the shade of the word by qualifying the word with a positive adjective. I find no better adjective than \"tireless\".) First, I do not know if the catchline is grammatically correct. If correct, I do not know if, for \"tireless\", a better adjective could be substituted.

So why not quantifying a learning that are not a lesson? The problem is to explain the difference between both since apparently there is no word that could define precisely (in a perfectly neutral way) what a learning is made of.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for a world that only keep the meaning 2 and 3 but that would not imply the teaching part: \"several things have been learned, but no lesson has been taught (<code>not even what positive or negative \"life lesson\"</code>). <code>You would not talk about \"evolutionary lessons\" for instance</code>. The things learned had no goals: learning just happened\".</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate this point, think about a fish. It did not really have to be taught to breath under water and to reproduce, but somehow by evolution the fish learned it, not strictly speaking at the individual scale but at the species scale. We could talk about \"evolutionary skills\". Those skills have been acquired without teaching but they are still in a way \"learned\" through many failed and successful adaptations and epigenetics which is a kind of innate learning. </p>\n\n<p>It comes handy also when speaking about animal <em>social learnings</em>, at least when we consider the \"learnings\" that have been learned (and accumulated through generations) but that haven't been \"taught\" (not even even vaguely through positive or negative \"life lessons\". I'm talking about evolutionary skills, like the fish example).</p>\n\n<p>Would you agree with the use of <em>learning<strong>s</em></strong> in this case?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT1: Imagine \"learning\" as a result (of a learning process). If it was commonly accepted in English, would you see the differences between some \"social learnings\" and some \"social lessons\"? I struggle to define precisely this difference (in french it's easy to see the difference between them, we have to words). I guess this \"teaching\" connotation (directly or indirectly) that bother me. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: The topic might be tricky because it talks about the line between nature and nurture. Some believe that this line is becoming more and more blurry, some people start to think that they is no line at all (can we really change more easily our environment than our innate nature?). Imagine a kind of learning that would be half way between innate and nurture, or even a learning that would be more innate than \"nurture\" (like specific epigenetics \"learnings\"). Don't you think \"learnings\" would come handy to talk about this last one?</p>\n"},{"id":211942,"title":"Word for a Person Skilled in Handicraft","body":"<p>I'm looking for a term to describe a person who is skilled in handicraft.
