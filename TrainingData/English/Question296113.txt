[{"id":296113,"title":"When is the word *mail* used in the sense of rent or payment?","body":"<p>When looking up the etymology of the word <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mail\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>mail</em></a> for the clearly distinct senses of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>things you use the postal service for; and</li>\n<li>armour (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_%28armour%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">chain mail</a>),</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I came across a third sense of the word, namely, rent or payment. Etymonline claims an example of this usage is the word <em>blackmail</em>. This third sense seems to be uncommon in modern English, at least to me, although the link to its use in the word <em>blackmail</em> sounds plausible. <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=blackmail\" rel=\"nofollow\">From Etymonline</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Middle English male \"rent, tribute,\" from Old English mal \"lawsuit, terms, bargaining, agreement,\" from Old Norse mal \"speech, agreement;\" related to Old English mæðel \"meeting, council,\" mæl \"speech,\" Gothic maþl \"meeting place,\" from Proto-Germanic *mathla-, from PIE *mod- \"to meet, assemble\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question: <strong>After Old English, where else is the word <em>mail</em> used in this third sense, and is <em>mail</em> used commonly in this sense anywhere in modern English?</strong> I'm looking for some idea of this word's life-cycle, so to speak. Era of common use ('era' in the sense of Elizabethan or modern), reasons for the word's decline in usage, derived words and regional usage are all in scope for this question.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> Following @HotLick's Scottish reference, I found <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blackmail\" rel=\"nofollow\">an entry at dictionary.com (search the text for <em>silver mail</em>)</a> that indicates a small group of words related to blackmail, starting from a rather crude reference to a fine (penalty) in the 1530s, going through <em>blackmail</em> in the 1550s with reference to protection rackets against Scottish farmers, then to <em>silver mail</em> in the 1590s.
