L. Armitage in Antiquity 68 (1994) 231–40).</li>\n  <li>A derivation &lt; an ablaut variant of the Indo-European base of classical Latin <em>rōdere</em> to gnaw (see rodent adj.) has been suggested, but seems unlikely in the light of the apparently recent introduction of the word.</li>\n  <li>A suggested derivation of the Romance words &lt; classical Latin <em>rapidus</em> rapid adj. is no longer accepted, as it would only account for the Italian, which for chronological and historical reasons cannot be the single origin of the whole group.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, I didn't stop ratting there and checked historical records that include the word \"rat\" and found the oldest etymological and lexical references as follows:</p>\n\n<p>From \"An universal etymological English dictionary\" <em>By Nathan Bailey</em> (1731):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BVczQ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"> <br>\n<sub>[<em>(obsolete)</em> Teut. -> Teutonic -> Germanic]</sub></p>\n\n<p>From \"A dictionary of the English language : in which the words are deduced from their originals, and illustrated in their different significations by examples from the best writers : to which are prefixed, a history of the language, and an English grammar\"\n <em>By Samuel Johnson</em> (1766):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eFqOY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>And the rat-hunting went on an' on and I ended up with the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat\">brown rat</a></em> (and its etymological origin) which is one of the best known and most common rat. It is named <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> (Norwegian rat) which is a misnomer because the English naturalist John Berkenhout gave the binomial name, believing it had migrated to England from Norwegian ships in 1728 (which is disproven later.)</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of 19th century, the etymology of <em>brown rat</em> was better understood and the following note is mentioned in \"Natural History\" <em>by American scholar Alfred Henry Miles</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The brown rat is the species common in England, and best known throughout the world. <strong>It is said to have travelled from Persia to England less than two hundred years ago</strong> and to have spread from thence to other countries visited by English ships</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This finding gives a hint that the origin of the word <em>rat</em> might be of <em>Persian</em> origin (and also <em>Sanskrit</em>)<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rat\"> [Wiktionary</a> puts as \"Middle Persian <em>randītan</em> (“to scrape, smooth”), Sanskrit <em>rádati</em> (“he gnaws, cuts”)).\"] </p>\n\n<p>Also mentioned in \"The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World\" <em>By J.

The pinyin <em>shǔ</em> of Han character 鼠 (rat) in Mandarin doesn't evoke anything, though I'm like a rat in a corner at this point. [Although, Sanskrit and Mandarin are from the same geographical region.)</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, <em>Persian</em> and <em>Sanskrit</em> origin makes sense and it wouldn't be possible to go further back (unless a <em>Hittite</em> origin? <em>Rats!</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Anything more to add?

I did search the site for an answer and didn't find one.</p>\n\n<p>With Googling, I accumulated a lot of interesting tidbits (below), but no good answer. The most repeated story follows.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-history-of-the-exclamation-point-16445416/?no-ist\">Smithsonian.com</a> posits that <strong>!</strong> has it's origin in the Latin exclamation of joy, <em>io</em>, where the <em>i</em> was written over the <em>o</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I was pretty surprised by this, as I have never seen it that way (given, I don't have a lot of Latin manuscripts hanging around.) They did state, though, that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...it wasn’t until 1970 that the exclamation point had its own key on the keyboard. Before that, you had to type a period, and then use the backspace to go back and stick an apostrophe above it.*</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark\">Wikipedia</a> gives the same origin as Smithsonian.com with a touch more detail:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The modern graphical representation is believed to have been born in the Middle Ages. The Medieval copyists used to write at the end of a sentence the Latin word io to indicate joy. The word io meant hurray. Along time, the i moved above the o, and the o became smaller, becoming a point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sources of the above are not easy to access.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stancarey.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/bang-pling-boing-shriek-gasper-screamer-christer-and-other-exclamation-mark-aliases/\">Sentence First</a> gave a colorful account of the various <em>names</em> for the exclamation mark, beginning with Ben Johnson's term for it: <em>admiration mark</em>, but, sadly, no history.</p>\n\n<p>The American Bookmaker, A Journal of Technical Art and Information states in the May, 1888 edition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The popular notion has always been that… the exclamation point (!) owes its existence to the Latin word Io (joy)… This explanation of the origin… is ingenious and one might almost say picturesque. For it, the world is indebted to one Willem Bilderdijk, a Dutch poet and philologist, born at Amsterdam in 1756. This entirely fanciful exegesis… goes to show that, with true poetic insight, Bilderdijk looked to his imagination rather than to scientific investigation for his facts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm inclined to believe the above. Again, however, no actual history is given.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"http://abcdefridays.blogspot.com/2014_09_01_archive.html\">in an unrelated entry about dropped caps</a>, a blogger posts an image of an illuminated manuscript that has what might possibly be interpreted as exclamation points (e.g. see Col. 1, third line from the bottom.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/GNan6.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/GNan6.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>However, above that, the same mark is found where there is a question in the Latin Vulgate (starting line 8 from the bottom):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Infirmatur quis in vobis (strange mark) inducat presbyteros ecclesiae <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/200698/58761\">et</a> orent super eum unguentes eum oleo in nomine Domini: <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/a/200698/58761\">et</a> oratio fidei salvabit infirmum (and here again the strange mark) et adlevabit eum Dominus et si in peccatis sit dimittentur ei... </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is any man sick among you?
