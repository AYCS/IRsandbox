We are told that by its aid the stars are\n  weighed and the billions of molecules in a drop of water are counted.\n  Yet, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, this science eludes the efforts of our mental weapons to grasp it - \"'Tis here, 'tis there, 'tis gone\" - and what we do see does not suggest the same excuse for illusiveness as sufficed for the ghost, that it is too noble for our gross methods. \"A show of violence,\" if ever excusable, may surely be \"offered\" to the trivial results which\n  occupy the pages of some elementary mathematical treatises.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am completely at sea trying to understand the last line, starting with \"A show of violence\"..</p>\n\n<p>Is he referring to The Tragedy of Hamlet (which I haven't read or know much about) or is a \"show of violence\" used as an expression or a metaphor?</p>\n"},{"id":139074,"title":"Meaning of &quot;Would you value the ethics of consequence over means?&quot;","body":"<p>I've been reading a book for a while and I've stumbled on the following sentence, which I didn't quite understand:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would you value the ethics of consequence over means?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The context is the following:\nPerson A steals a valuable book and doesn't tell his superiors (In the book, this is punishable by death, since he's hiding information and this act caused a war earlier), person B is As friend and doesn't do anything about the book (person B is religious). </p>\n\n<p>The mentioned superiors find out about the book and thus, person A is sent to court, where person B is a witness.</p>\n\n<p>Person A asks B to lie, but him being religious, isn't able to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Since B didn't lie in court, but did nothing before the act of hiding the information was found out (aka \"I'm all good with it until there isn't something for me to lose), is called a hypocrite by person A, so he goes through a psychological drama, before talking to person C (person C being a priest and a good friend of person B).</p>\n\n<p>During the discussion, person B lets C in on his drama and gives the aforementioned question as answer to his person Bs psychological drama.</p>\n"},{"id":138416,"title":"How should this sentence be interpreted?","body":"<p>So I am reading the essay \"On Some Verses of Virgil\" by Michel de Montaigne (translation by Donald M.

We find that what we were calling a cold or a sprain is the gout. The diseases of the soul grow more obscure as they grow stronger; the sickest man is least sensible of them. That is why they must be handled often in the light of day, with a pitiless hand, be opened up and torn from the hollow of our breast.
