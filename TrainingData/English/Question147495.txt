Do judges have different seating arrangements from congressmen?</p>\n\n<p>In more detail, do legislators (congressmen) sit on different appliances as compared to judges? Why does \"bench\" imply the judicial branch more than the legislative branch? Do judges sit on benches while senators sit on armchairs?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, what is the origin of describing the judges as sitting specifically on a \"bench\"? I assume what they sit on is padded just as much as your typical senator's seat.  </p>\n\n<p>Note1: @TimLymington pointed out in a comment that what is relevant is the <em>length</em> of the bench, with <em>several</em> judges sitting on it.  Meanwhile, members of other branches of goverment usually sit on <em>individual</em> seats.  This seems to be the explanation of the expression dating back to the 13th century.   TimLymington can format his comment as an answer so I could \"accept\" it.</p>\n\n<p>Note 2: the comment at wiki that the bench is where the judges sit appears to be incorrect.  Rather the \"bench\" seems to refer to the table where they work.</p>\n\n<p>Note 3. When a judge tells a barrister to \"approach the bench\", as in this post: <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1153/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://xkcd.com/1153/</a> he typically does not mean to imply that the barrister should aim for the judge's seat, but rather the table/desk/bench.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":247019,"title":"Is &quot;And this X?&quot; a common English expression?","body":"<p>In Spanish we say, \"And this X?\" as a short form for \"And who is X?\" Example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I entered the room with Billy, Tom looked up and said, \"And this high school brat?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this also a common expression in English?
