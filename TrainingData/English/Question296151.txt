SENATOR BISHOP felt that the Constitution is a document that should grow along with the people. Mr. Campbell stated that all people should be treated equally under the Constitution. <strong>He would rather see all gambling banned instead of fracturing people's rights</strong>. SENATOR BISHOP maintained that in 1972 we did not have legalized gambling in Montana. Mr. Campbell stated the Constitution banned it completely. There was a side issue asking whether the people wanted the legislature to regulate gambling or not.
