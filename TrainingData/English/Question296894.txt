[{"id":296894,"title":"What do you call someone who (over)uses archaic terms and expressions while writing?","body":"<p>I came across a literary article from one of my cousin's numerous English books. The author, in what I presume to be an effort to showcase their vocabulary and command over English, seems to have largely (ab)used outdated English terms, forcing me to flip pages in dictionaries every few sentences. One such instance would be the use of \"<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/betimes\">betimes</a>\" instead of \"early\". While learning new words is always a good thing, I would have preferred less use of antiquated terms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My questions</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is there an adjective or noun to describe such practice?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are archaic expressions and words more preferred (than simple, everyday words) by authors of English literary articles? </p></li>\n</ul>\n","related_questions":[{"id":267101,"title":"What do you call someone who does a favor for you?","body":"<p>I'm looking for a single word, something like \"good samaritan\" but more specific; someone who does a favor for you but not necessarily an acquaintance.

In my request detail window, I have a field called \"Requested By\" to store the name of the person who made the request. However, \"Requested By\" is very hard to use in a message such as:</p>\n\n<p>\"Do you really want to send an email to the requested by?\"</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for a noun to replace \"requested by\". So, my question is: What do you call someone who makes a request?</p>\n\n<p>The requester, the initiator...</p>\n\n<p>I have already rejected \"Applicant\" because in my case the user is not applying; he is requesting.</p>\n"},{"id":128043,"title":"What is it called when you write what someone is saying?","body":"<p>Imagine you're sitting in the corner, writing down a conversation that is occurring in the middle of the room.
