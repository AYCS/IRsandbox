We call this habit “歩きスマホ – aruki sumaho – using a smart-phone while walking” in Japanese. It’s a derivative of “歩きタバコ – aruki tabaco – smoking while walking.” Aruki sumaho is really dangerous because you might hit a pedestrian when you are looking into a smartphone while you are walking; similarly, “aruki tabaco” inflicts a burn if the lit cigarette touches the face or hand of a passer-by. Actually, many cases of injuries caused by “aruki sumaho” (such as a fall from a subway platform) were reported. I saw a young man looking into a smartphone while riding a bicycle on the pavement recently. I learned that the similar trends are observed today in many parts of the world on TV.</p>\n\n<p>What do you call “aruki sumaho – looking into a smartphone while walking” and “a walker looking into smart phone” in brief English words?</p>\n"},{"id":252186,"title":"English equivalent of two popular Chinese slangs: 学霸 (academic overlord) and 学婊 (academic bitch)","body":"<p>In popular Chinese language, especially in Internet Chinese language, we use the word \"学霸\" (literally meaning \"academic overlord\") to refer to someone who does very well in his/her study and who always achieve high grades in exams.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we use another word \"学婊\" (literally meaning \"academic bitch\") when we (jokingly, without any malicious meaning) speak of someone who does excellently in his/her study but who likes hiding it from the others, which is their most important difference from \"学霸\" : for example, if you ask a \"学婊\" about how he/she feels about the last exam he/she will most probably tell you \"Oh it was too hard for me. I really messed it up, and I must get an F this time!\" while in fact he/she performed excellently, perhaps much better than most of the others in that exam.</p>\n\n<p>So are there English equivalents for these two Chinese Internet slangs? As far as I know, in U.S. the word \"<a href=\"http://www.echineselearning.com/blog/xueba-curve-wrecker-at-school\" rel=\"nofollow\">curve-wrecker</a>\" might take similar meaning to \"学霸\", and I'm wondering if there is any other alternative word. But for an English counterpart to \"学婊\", I simply have no idea.\n<br>\n<hr>\n<strong>EDIT</strong> I think maybe I need to clarify more about the word \"学婊\". First it is not equivalent to \"modesty\", although \"modesty\" can sometimes explain a \"学婊\"'s behavior. I think maybe the word <em>\"sandbagger\"</em> in @Avangion's answer in the meaning \"downplay or misrepresent one's ability\" is by now the closest word, although it might take too much derogatory tinge.<br><br>\nGenerally \"学婊\" is a teasing/joking word and is rarely used as an insult. And the motivations why a \"学婊\" downplays his ability or mispresents performance may be:<br><br>\n1). He/she knows that this exam was super-hard and most people do feel bad about it. So when asked about how he/she feels about it, he/she will not tell them the truth that he/she did quite well, so as not to hurt other people's feelings.<br><br>\n2). Out of modesty. And this part may have been hardwired into Chinese cultural genes from ancient times -- showing off is almost always despiced in Chinese cultural context ,and modesty regarded as a significant virtue.<br><br>\n3). To deceive his/her peer components by downplaying. This is not the usual case, but can happen.\n<br>\n<hr>\n<strong>EDIT AGAIN</strong> According to JanusBahsJacquet's comment (I failed to find the link), the Wikipedia definition describes it as <strong>someone who “pretends not to cram before an exam, then breaks down in hysterics after and gets comforted by everyone, only to appear top of the class when the results are shown”</strong>, which I think is a pretty typical and accurate description.</p>\n"},{"id":167299,"title":"How do you say &quot;question de cours&quot; in English?","body":"<p>In French, <em>une question de cours</em>, is a question in a test for which you just need to know the content of your course.

Basically a person, often a scientist, who began or further significantly developed a new concept or theory by contributing epoch-making publications or comments. Translation services give out expressions that have more the connotation of thinking about actual future events or things to me, e.g. innovative business ideas/products or future studies. But <em>Vordenker</em> doesn’t imply thinking of future actually, rather new ideas outside of current paradigms. Also <em>Vordenker</em> is in my opinion especially used in a historical or biographical context, as you can only judge his influence retrospectively (e.g. times cited). <strong>A lot of scientists in German wikipedia are described as <em>Vordenker</em> in the first sentence while there seems to be no common english term in the english wikipedia.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Thought leader</em> has a too imperative character.</p>\n\n<p><em>Forward thinker</em> implies to me thinking of future itself.</p>\n\n<p><em>Key figure</em> is too inexact.</p>\n\n<p><em>Visionary</em> means someone with new ideas, which possibly never have come true in retrospect.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pre-thinker</em> sounds like awkward &amp; uncommon English.
