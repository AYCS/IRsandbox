And the usage of the second meaning seems like more common. (It might need analysis).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>1</strong>. if someone is a dead weight, they are very heavy and difficult to carry, often because they are not conscious. <em>Tom was a dead weight and her muscles ached as she carried him upstairs.</em> <br>\n  <strong>2</strong>. something or someone who prevents other people from making progress <em>We must free ourselves from the dead weight of history.</em> <em>She's just a dead weight on the business at the moment.</em> <br>\n  <sub>Source: <a href=\"http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+dead+weight\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+dead+weight</a></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think there is a misperception of dead being heavier than alive and it is reflected to languages also but technically it is not correct. A dead body has the same weight of an alive body. The misperception comes from that an alive (conscious) person can distribute weight and adjust the center of gravity for a better balance. But, \"dead weight\" is the center of mass being wherever supported, lacking any effort on their part, and therefore concentrated in one spot, more or less.</p>\n\n<p>Why am I saying all of these?
