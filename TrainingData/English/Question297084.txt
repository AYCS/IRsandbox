As these two examples from <a href=\"http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/typical\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary</a>,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>This meal is typical of local cookery</em>. (intrinsic)<br>\n  <em>A typical working day for me begins at 7.30.</em> (extrinsic)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But soon I felt abash when I found someone mentioned question 7 in this <a href=\"http://www.english-test.net/esl/learn/english/grammar/ei091/esl-test.php#seven\" rel=\"nofollow\">English Grammar Test, Elementary Level # 71</a>,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Such bad behavior is typical .......... the spoiled child.<br></p>\n  \n  <p>a) for<br>\n  b) with<br>\n  c) about<br>\n  d) of</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question was listed under <em>\"british vs. american english\"</em>, implying that each dialect prefers one usage over another.
