Even an idol singer, actor / actress closes his or her ending messages from the  stage to audience with “Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.” </p>\n\n<p>“Yoroshiku” is really a convenient word with which we can dispense with any other thinkable greeting / thank-you messages. </p>\n\n<p>Even though it may sound a bit exaggerated, you can do well with four basic words, “Douzo – Please,” “Arigato – Thank you,”  “Yoroshiku” and \"Sayonara - Good bye\" in social interaction in Japan.</p>\n\n<p>Though I think this is a special parlance unique to Japanese, I heard Chinese, 請多関照-<em>qing duo guanzhao</em>-has a similar meaning.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if there are common or universally used English greeting words that can be compared to “Yoroshiku onegaishimasu” or, “Yoroshiku”, whose main intention is none other than to give a good impression.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":290998,"title":"Is &quot;during the middle of&quot; proper English?","body":"<p>In <a href=\"http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/44151/what-changes-to-mockingjay-part-2-were-made-due-to-p-s-hoffmans-passing\">this question on the Movies &amp; TV Stack Exchange</a> the question starts with the following observation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who portrayed a character in The Hunger\n  Games, passed away <strong>during the middle of</strong> filming for the Mockingjay\n  movies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not a native speaker, but to me this sounds incorrect.
