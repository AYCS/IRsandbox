You know, Miss Fagina. I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have been known to be jealous. I'm sorry. </p>\n  \n  <p>Austin Powers: No, don't be sorry, baby. You're right to be suspicious. I <strong>shagged</strong> her. </p>\n  \n  <p>Vanessa Kensington: What? </p>\n  \n  <p>Austin Powers: I <strong>shagged</strong> her rotten, baby, yeah! </p>\n  \n  <p>Vanessa Kensington: I don't believe you, Austin! I mean, she was repellant. </p>\n  \n  <p>Austin Powers: Saucer of milk, table 2. Meow. </p>\n  \n  <p>Vanessa Kensington: Well, did you use protection? </p>\n  \n  <p>Austin Powers: Of course. I had my 9mm automatic. </p>\n  \n  <p>Vanessa Kensington: You know I meant 'did you use a condom'? </p>\n  \n  <p>Austin Powers: No. Only sailors use condoms, baby. </p>\n  \n  <p>Vanessa Kensington: Not in the 90's, Austin. </p>\n  \n  <p>Austin Powers: Well they should, those filthy buggers. They go from port to port.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is, where did this sense of <em>shag</em> come from? The OED calls this copulatory sense “of obscure origin” and provides a first citation dating from Grose’s <em>Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</em> of 1788, in which the modern sense is first given.</p>\n\n<p>But where does it <strong>really</strong> come from? Surely if it made a vulgar dictionary in 1788, there must be possible antedatings of the written not merely oral form. </p>\n"},{"id":247343,"title":"Yikes!

The earliest citation for <em>yikes</em> in OED is from 1971 but <em>Etymonline</em> gives 1953.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, for this sense of <em>yikes</em>, the earliest citations I could find are from 1960 (from the book <em>Where the boys are</em> by Glendon Fred Swarthout):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RJgES.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P3q9H.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The earlier examples I could find are related to <strong><em>yike</em></strong> meaning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An imitation of the cry of the woodpecker. <em>[OED]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The verb <em>yike</em> is a derivative.</p>\n\n<p>This sense of <em>yike</em> suggests that <em>yikes</em> might be an onomatopoeia also. For example, a similar word <em>eek</em> is an imitative of a shriek or squeak.</p>\n\n<p>In the light of these findings, what would be the conclusion and can we find other credible sources? There are two possible routes here and <em>OED</em> is bold to say that origin of <em>yikes</em> is unknown. The possible ultimate origin <em>hoicks</em> has an unknown origin also, according to <em>OED</em>. Why wouldn't it be mentioned as onomatopoeic?
