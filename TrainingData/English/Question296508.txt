For instance, \"watch this\" and \"this watch\" have clearly different meanings.  In mathematics, we call this <em>non-commutativity</em>, and it is deeply interesting.

If I say, \"last Saturday\" I mean April 11th; if I say, \"this Saturday\" I mean April 18th; and if I say \"next Saturday\" I mean April 25th - although I admit it gets a little ambiguous when \"this\" saturday is several days away. But I would definitely be speaking of the 22nd if I were to say, \"next Wednesday\" (not the 15th, for that is tomorrow, and to say \"next\" would sound/seem bizarre to me.</p>\n\n<p>Note/Addendum: I would not say \"last Monday\" for yesterday, because in that case I simply say that (\"yesterday\"); similary, I would not call tomorrow \"this Wednesday\" for a similar reason - I refer to that simply as \"tomorrow\".</p>\n\n<p>I find, though, that many people consider \"this Monday\" to have been yesterday (the 13th), not \"this <em>coming</em>\" Monday (which is how I see it).</p>\n\n<p>I do recognize some logic in this alternate viewpoint provided everybody were to agree that the \"this\" refers to a current week, beginning on Sunday, or Monday, depending on which day is considered a week's beginning point (and so, the differing standard in regards to that question is a matter of contention/confusion in and of itself).</p>\n\n<p>Another way of expressing it, I guess, would be to say that I always consider myself as being in a sliding scale of time, rather than in a particular calendar week, one which stays fixed for an entire week. In other words, today I am in a week that runs from Tuesday the 14th through Monday the 20th. Tomorrow I will be in a week that runs from Wednesday the 15th  through Tuesday 21st, etc. Others apparently always view themselves as being somewhere in a week that runs either from Sunday-Saturday, or Monday-Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>Am I definitely wrong in my take on \"last, this, and next\" or is it just \"different strokes for different folks\"? I'm curious how many others (if any?) view time from \"my\" perspective?</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is, I always find it beneficial to mention specific dates.

Two people are debating, and one says \"the difference between your position and mine is just a matter of semantics.\"   This would seem to me to be quite an important difference.  That is, if one person means one thing, and the other person means something else, then they really do have different positions.</p>\n\n<p>If they said \"it is just a matter of terminology\" or \"just a matter of phrasing\" I would get it.  But if someone says \"we differ only what we mean\" ... it kinda makes me chuckle because it seems to be saying that their meaning is not important, as if the argument was primary and the positions they take a secondary consideration.</p>\n\n<p>So I started looking around for examples of this. I guess it seems that there is a popular notion that semantics is about very fine distinctions, such as: <a href=\"http://www.democraticunderground.com/?com=view_post&amp;forum=1018&amp;pid=160186\">I think it's just a matter of semantics, not so much a difference per se</a></p>\n\n<p>Another interpretation seems to be that semantics is the difference between two ways of saying the same thing: <a href=\"http://www.marvinmarshall.com/class-creates-rules/\">I usually involve the students in the creation of classroom rules.  To me, we are just agreeing upon how we can make our classroom a safe and fun place to be. I don’t know if it’s really so different from a DWS approach of having procedures, but “no rules.”  Isn’t this just a matter of semantics?</a></p>\n\n<p>Maybe it is just a way of stopping an annoying conversation: <a href=\"http://secularhumanist.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-matter-of-semantics-words-concepts.html\">In ordinary conversations, when people debate a point and the words they are using for discussion they often backhand this disagreement with the phrase “It’s a matter of semantics.” </a></p>\n\n<p>And then there is some usage that I simply don't understand:  <a href=\"http://www.robbinswritings.com/blog/2011/2/21/is-your-message-just-a-matter-of-semantics.html\">I recently spoke at a mens' event in which one of the participants asked me if having a good and noble heart was just a matter of semantics. -- In other words, does it really matter?</a></p>\n\n<p>And also: <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201102240593.html\">The Argument for and against the 6-3-3-4 system of education has raged on as stakeholders give conflicting position on whether it stays or not  ....  the 6-3-3-4 policy is just a matter of semantics, the government cannot take decisions without due consultations.</a></p>\n\n<p>Still, to me it is just a meaningless phrase.
