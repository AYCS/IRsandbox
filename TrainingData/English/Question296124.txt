(head hair vs. body hair)","body":"<p>The answer can be \"Because it doesn't!\" or \"It wasn't needed!\" in short but there might be a historical or linguistic explanation behind this. (Of course, every language might be lacking a word that another language has and you can give the meaning in a context.)</p>\n\n<p>This question came up mainly because there are several languages which has separate words for head hair and body hair. For example, head hair is <strong><em>capelli</em></strong> in Italian, <strong><em>saç</em></strong> in Turkish, <strong><em>cheveu</em></strong> in French and <strong><em>kopfhaar</em></strong> in German. But in English, hair is like a hypernym for head hair and body hair.</p>\n\n<p>When we check the <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hair\">etymology of hair</a>, the origin is related to the German word <em>haar</em>. And interestingly, German language came up with <em>kopfhaar</em> which literally means headhair.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Old English <strong>hær</strong> \"hair, a hair,\" from Proto-Germanic *khæran (cognates: Old Saxon, Old Norse, Old High German <strong>har</strong>, Old Frisian her, Dutch and German <strong>haar</strong> \"hair\"), perhaps from PIE <strong>*ghers-</strong> \"to stand out, to bristle, rise to a point\" (cognates: Lithuanian serys \"bristle;\" see horror). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When we dive into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_hair\">biology</a>, we can see that there are structural differences between body hair and head hair but they are composed of the same substance, keratin. Though, there is a distinction in terminology:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Androgenic hair</strong>, colloquially <strong>body hair</strong>, is the terminal hair that develops on the human body during and after puberty. It is differentiated from the <strong>head hair</strong> and less visible vellus hair, which are much finer and lighter in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And a twist ending: Wiktionary has a definition (and even an etymology) for \"<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/headhair\">headhair</a>\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From Middle English *heed-heer, from Old English hēafodhǣr (“hair of the head, headhair”), equivalent to head +‎ hair. Cognate with Dutch hoofdhaar (“headhair”), German Haupthaar (“headhair”), Danish hovedhår (“headhair”), Swedish huvudhår (“headhair”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can see that \"<a href=\"https://www.google.ca/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=3GiWU9eZOeKM8Qez-IGIDA&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=%22headhair%22&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=bks\">headhair</a>\" is used in a few sources but it is not common. Personally I haven't encountered this word before I did this research. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How come both \"hair\" and \"headhair\" emerged (for the same meaning)?</li>\n<li>Why didn't \"headhair\" gain a common usage? What happened in the\nhistory?</li>\n<li>Does \"headhair\" have a current usage? (only in technical sources?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just to emphasize, the question is not only about finding words, its about the history and origin of the words as well. Also, the question can be: \"Why doesn't English have a <strong><em>common</em></strong> separate word for “head hair”?
