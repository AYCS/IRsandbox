In many other languages, a vector is said to have <em>three</em> properties: directions correspond to <em>lines</em> (so that a vector pointing up and one pointing down have the same up-down direction), and a third property determines which way the vector is pointing along that line (up or down in our example).</p>\n\n<p>This may seem strange at first, but it's actually very useful to separate these concepts in mathematics.
