The earliest citation for <em>yikes</em> in OED is from 1971 but <em>Etymonline</em> gives 1953.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, for this sense of <em>yikes</em>, the earliest citations I could find are from 1960 (from the book <em>Where the boys are</em> by Glendon Fred Swarthout):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/RJgES.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/P3q9H.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The earlier examples I could find are related to <strong><em>yike</em></strong> meaning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An imitation of the cry of the woodpecker. <em>[OED]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The verb <em>yike</em> is a derivative.</p>\n\n<p>This sense of <em>yike</em> suggests that <em>yikes</em> might be an onomatopoeia also. For example, a similar word <em>eek</em> is an imitative of a shriek or squeak.</p>\n\n<p>In the light of these findings, what would be the conclusion and can we find other credible sources? There are two possible routes here and <em>OED</em> is bold to say that origin of <em>yikes</em> is unknown. The possible ultimate origin <em>hoicks</em> has an unknown origin also, according to <em>OED</em>. Why wouldn't it be mentioned as onomatopoeic?
