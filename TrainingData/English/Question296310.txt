E.g., \"I ain't\" is definitely not considered correct, but there's no real reason it shouldn't be allowed as an alternative to \"I'm not\".</p>\n\n<p>I understand one reason for prescriptive grammar, essentially to make communication possible. It essentially establishes rules, and speech would quickly get confusing if we had no rules. But some of the things it prohibits seem to have little to do with facilitating communication, and more with just upholding some arbitrary status quo. \"Swag\" is a really annoying word, but it doesn't really make sense to say it's not an \"official word\" or something if millions of people are using it and all know what it means among each other.</p>\n\n<p>Why exactly do prescriptivists even really want this?

So I would say I have the impression that the knowledge in grammar matters of English mother-tongue speakers\nis as an average lower when compared to speakers of other languages.\nI am not quite sure whether everybody will agree.\nI wonder what may be the causes.\nOne cause is obvious. As English has reduced almost all grammatical endings and has elegantly replaced the function of grammatical endings by other means such as prepositions, auxiliary verbs, modal verbs and position it is a lot more difficult\nto see how the grammar system of English works.\nI am astonished to see how many people have problems with basic grammar things such as word classes or structures of sentences.\nBut I assume there must be other causes.
