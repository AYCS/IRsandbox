[{"id":292660,"title":"Why did Old English use C while other Germanic languages used K?","body":"<p>During most the first millennium CE, North and West Germanic languages were written in runic alphabets. Gradually, each language shifted from the runic alphabet to the Latin alphabet. The people who adapted the Latin alphabet for use with a new language chose which letters to align with which sounds. For the phoneme /k/, the Latin alphabet offered two choices: C and K. In most cases K was chosen, and to this day German, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages make very sparing use of C, except in digraphs like CH. But for Old English, they opted for C, and in fact K is not even included in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_Latin_alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Old English Latin alphabet</a>. Why the difference?</p>\n\n<p>--EDIT--</p>\n\n<p>After some answers and a bit more research, it is clear that Old English used C, following the practice of the Insular Celtic languages, which followed the practice of Latin. So the question becomes: Why did the other Germanic languages use K? Why did they adopt the Latin alphabet but not the Latin practice of using C?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":160523,"title":"Wer, wie, was, wieso, weshalb, warum, all start with W in German.
