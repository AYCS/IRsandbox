British spellings like \"metre\" and \"centre\" are consistently switched to \"meter\" and \"center,\" respectively, in American spelling, but it seems like \"theater\" and \"theatre\" are both used in American spelling.

However, while reading a text about differences between British and American English I read the following lines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here's something else for Americans to be aware of: did you know that an <em>eraser</em> is called a <em>rubber</em> in Britain? A good British Mum makes sure her children go to school with a rubber in their pencil case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it's also not new to me that there are differences between British English and American English, but I was and still am surprised that that could somehow be misinterpreted.</p>\n\n<p>Checking the dictionary (<a href=\"http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/rubber\">OALD</a> and <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rubber?q=rubber\">OED</a>) I learned that <em>rubber</em> as <em>condom</em> is indeed an Americanism, though I can hardly believe that British people do not know/use that word.</p>\n\n<p>The other way round, I can imagine to some extent that Americans are not aware of the fact that it isn't that popularly known/used in British English.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, when talking to British people do I really have to expect that they don't know what I'm talking about when using the word <em>rubber</em> instead of <em>condom</em>?</p>\n\n<p>And when talking to American people, should I avoid <em>rubber</em> and use <em>eraser</em> instead whenever I expect it might sound ambiguous?

In\n  both English and French, many words with this ending have been adopted\n  (usually via Latin), and many more have been invented by adding the\n  suffix to existing words. In modern French the verb stem has become\n  -iser, and this may have encouraged the use of -ise in English, especially in verbs that have reached English via French. The -ise\n  spelling of verbs is now very common in British use, and Oxford\n  dictionaries published in the UK generally show both forms where they\n  are in use, but give -ize first as it reflects both the origin and the\n  pronunciation more closely, while indicating that -ise is an allowable\n  variant. Usage varies across the English-speaking world, so it is\n  important to record both spellings where they exist. There are a\n  number of verbs with only one accepted spelling â€“ advise and capsize,\n  for example. This is not just perverse: they have different\n  etymologies. The important thing is that people should be consistent\n  in the form they use in a given document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, from the way things are being presented, it does give me the impression that the American spelling is given a higher priority in a dictionary that is prepared by a renowned British university.
