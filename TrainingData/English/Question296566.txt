Can ‘case’ be used as a verb on the earth?\nIf it is a noun, don’t we need a possessive case ‘s? \nIf it is a verb, don’t we need a third person, singular, present tense s? \nIs some words (eg. made, made out) dropped before ‘case’ just for the purpose of contraction?</p>\n\n<p>I suspect this is a very primitive question.

The reason I point this out is that I believe it might be a regional thing.</p>\n\n<p>Many people in that area omit the word \"is\" in sentences. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<p>They sent an image and then included this in chat: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Just ran across this. It a good pic of [whatever was in the picture].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I expect to see \"is\" before \"a good pic\".</p>\n\n<p>And again, another picture and description: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This my youngest daughter and her husband.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I expect to see \"is\" after the word \"this\".</p>\n\n<p>This is very common with this person, as they also sent this message: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"[Person's name] getting old enough to make [their] own decisions. I know what it like to be a child in middle of divorce.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I expect to see \"is\" after the person's name as well as after \"what it\" (or at least the contraction \"it's\"). </p>\n\n<p>Also, they linked to a meme image originally posted by a radio station in Phoenix, AZ that had the following text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It's not what's under the Christmas tree that matters, it's who around it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would expect to see another \"is\" (the first one being part of the contraction) after the word \"who\". Or, even another contraction (who's).</p>\n\n<p>I supply all of these examples to demonstrate the omission. It seems very common to the area. I don't think this is the same situation as <a href=\"https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/40795/omitting-is-like-in-i-think-it-strange\" title=\"Another question about the omission of &#39;is&#39;\">this</a> question.</p>\n\n<p>I have lived my entire life (over 40 years) without ever seeing this before.
