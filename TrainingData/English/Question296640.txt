Is it becoming a popular English word?","body":"<p>I found the word ‘Point Omega’ in the article of New York Times (February 17) titled “My life with boxes” written by Anne Biattie, the author of recent work “New Yorker stories,” who loves to collect free cardboard boxes to store her valuables and non-valuables including family albums, books, manuscripts, stained letters, a long ago invitation she couldn’t attend, underwear, socks, 15 nightgowns and so on:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are actually more socks since last I looked, they’ve expanded\n  in the dresser drawers, and the family albums have apparently been\n  keeping pace with them: my parents’ (deceased; this makes everything\n  more difficult, of course) trip to St. Martin, with no photograph\n  showing their presence. It could be a Don DeLillo novel; it’s my own\n  “<strong>Point Omega</strong>.” I understand that what I have is the absence of that\n  presence I wish to have. Still: what monster could drop the album in\n  the garbage?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks to her mention of Don DeLillo, I was able to locate where the word, ‘Point Omega’ came from, but I don’t know what it exactly means only from the following quote online as a clue: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you reveal everything, bare every feeling, ask for understanding,\n  you lose something crucial to your sense of yourself. You need to know\n  things that others don't know. It's what no one knows about you that\n  allows you to know yourself.― Don DeLillo, Point Omega.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does “Point Omega” mean the core of self-identity i.e., my being?
