So neither of those would apply.</p>\n\n<p>Some more obscure meaning that I found was to clear some place of outlaws or of something bad or unjust.

This could actually be a fit. Energy, light, radiance and cold can indeed wash over an area or over something. But it didn't seemed to be a usual way for this verb to be used and even more, be used FOUR times and many places of a book. Also, all the sentences can have the implication of some pain being inflicted, maybe by burning (cold and radiance burn).</p>\n\n<p>So I came here to find out if that could be the case, and what could a english speaker make from the sentences on a first read.
