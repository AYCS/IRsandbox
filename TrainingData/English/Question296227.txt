Skype.  As a native speaker, I knew \"instinctively\" to pronounce this \"sky p,\" not \"sky pee.\"</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to now and it is very common in my classroom to hear students pronounce this \"Sky pee.\"  Same with \"you tu bee\" (<em>YouTube</em>). My usual answer to why the ‘e’ is not pronounced is not satisfying to me, maybe students accept it because \"English makes no sense,\" but I cannot accept that.</p>\n\n<p>Just a quick look through <em>The First Folio</em> shows that many English words used to have an ‘e’ at the end, words that now don't.  I cannot say whether those words were pronounced differently because of the ‘e’.  My guess, based on the little I know about original pronunciation, is that they weren't pronounced differently, in the sense of \"ee\" sound added to the end, as in \"tree.\"</p>\n\n<p>If I had to guess about the ‘e’ I would say that some of the words picked up the ‘e’ because they have a German root in which the ‘e’ is pronounced.  However, I have seen \"tell\" spelled \"telle\" and \"show\" spelled \"showe.\"</p>\n\n<p>Various answers I have come across: 1. Printers were paid extra for extra letters so they added ‘e’ to get paid more. 2. That's English, so get over it. 3. No one knows, same as no one really knows who shot JFK and if they say they know they're liars. 4. The old days of English spelling were the \"Wild West\" and anything went until Sheriff Webster brought law and order to the untamed frontier, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Silent ‘e’ is such a big thing that most native speakers are familiar with the term and learn it in school or on <em>Sesame Street</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why was ‘e’ added to the end of so many words, if it wasn't going to be pronounced?</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:  I understand that ‘e’ changes the pronunciation and that English has many exceptions and variations.  But, at one time it wasn't haphazard; \"show\" and \"old\" were written with an ‘e’.  Why if it wasn't pronounced?  <em>Old</em> is pronounced \"old.\"  The ‘e’ isn't necessary to change the vowels.  How else would it be pronounced?  What about \"have\"? Was the ‘e’ swept along with all of \"Olde Englishe\" other spellings?</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few words that used to have ‘e’ at the end: <em>learne</em>, <em>stuffe</em>, <em>sadnesse</em>, <em>mee</em>, <em>selfe</em>, <em>minde</em>, <em>flye</em>, <em>grasse</em>, <em>harme</em>, <em>winde</em>, <em>quicke</em>, <em>alwayes</em>, <em>worke</em>, <em>lordshippe</em>, <em>booke</em> (but <em>foot</em> often did not have the ‘e’ added) etc., etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong>: I am not interested in an answer or comment that points me to a website containing rules and observations about silent ‘e’.  I don't want an answer that tells me that silent ‘e’ changes <em>can</em> into <em>cane</em>; a long sound, I already know that.  Ermanam's answer is a step in the right direction, however there are so many words that used to have an ‘e’ tacked on to the end and don't seem to follow any reasoning that I can see.  Why an ‘e’ and not an ‘i’ or some symbol that wasn't a letter?  What about the word \"<em>sadnesse</em>\"?  What's the ‘e’ there for?</p>\n"},{"id":286156,"title":"Does &quot;Mafia&quot; come from Sicilian meaning &quot;death to the French&quot;?","body":"<p>Someone once mentioned to me (must have been a Sicilian patriot or something) that in some kind of ancient long-forgotten Sicilian slang the word \"mafia\" actually meant \"Death to the French!\"</p>\n\n<p>I mean, it stands to reason. There are rumors that the Cosa Nostra was born on the very night when all Sicilians, or all Sicilians worth speaking of, anyway, rose as one and wiped out all businessmen from Anjou in Palermo and elsewhere to keep them from oppressing them economically. Or something. There's a very popular opera by Giuseppe Verdi on the subject. For obvious reasons, there is no French opera on the same subject. </p>\n\n<p>The word \"mafia\" has been an English word for quite a while; thus, the question is legitimate: could it be true? Was it really Sicilian initially, and did it really mean \"Death to the French!\"? I've heard other stories ... I mean, versions ... but this one is awfully romantic, and we're all romantics at heart.

A bit late for Breton but perhaps it was in use then.</p>\n\n<p>Bretons poem 'Fooles-cappe' describes what is foolish, and it's the fool that's 'in love with every Nannicocke'.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hee that doth wonder at a Weathercocke,<br>\n  And plaies weith every feather in the winde,<br>\n  And is in love with every Nannicocke;<br>\n  Yet scarcely knows an Orange by the Rinde:<br>\n  When every Foole is found out in his kinde,<br>\n    How is it possible but he should passe,<br>\n    For a poore silly simple witted Asse?  </p>\n  \n  <p>Hee that doth think it is no Wickednesse,<br>\n  To lead a young man into Wantonnesse;<br>\n  But takes delight in all Ungodliness;<br>\n  Until the Heart in Sorrowes heavinesse,<br>\n  Doe shewe the fruits of Wils unhappinesse;<br>\n   Let that vile villaine reade in Vertues Schooles,<br>\n   Such wicked wretches are Ungratious Fooles  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The collection of Bretons works was published in 1879 and the publishers added some notes to the work to help understand the more obscure terms. In those notes they provide a definition for Nannicocke as 'same as nanny-hen (i.e. effected, over-nice)' and I'm not sure if their use of 'effected' was supposed to be 'affected' but I can't find any other definition of 'nanny-hen' apart from modern ones where a hen takes over another hens brood.</p>\n\n<p>A little later Pepys ballad 'The Frightened People of Clarkenwel 1689 (Being an Account how a COW Ran into the Church at Clarkenwel in Sermon time)' uses 'Nannicock' as the name for 'his' cow.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Clerkenwell-Church there was a Rout,<br>\n  Last Sunday the People like Bedlams run out,<br>\n  And what shou'd this fearful stir be about,<br>\n     But Nannicock my poor Cow, poor Cow;<br>\n      But Nannicock my poor Cow.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later in the ballad he mentions large horns, suggesting it was not a young heifer (which I thought may be some symbolism for a young girl). I find it odd that Pepys would use a word that appears to be a nonce-word as a name for 'his' cow without good reason.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I looked up Nannicock was from Edisson (Mistress of Mistresses : A Vision of Zimiamvia from 1935), but the character that uses the word uses it to describe a man (his cousin in fact) and most certainly someone he knows is not a fool.\nBrief context for the OED quote is that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Lessingham (representing Parry by virtue of being his cousin) and Duke\n  Barganax (hoping to become lord of Zayana) have agreed to split up the kingdom without directly\n  involving Horius Parry, the Vicar of Rerek.<br>\n  As one of the Vicar's aides tells him of the agreement between Lessingham and the Duke he\n  asks the aide....<br>\n  'Damned measled hog, answer to the matter, or we'll\n  cut your tongue out: was it well done to entrust my borders to this\n  nannicock, for Zayana to make use of as the monkey do the cat's foot?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Nannicock is referring to Lessingham, a man that Parry had trusted to do his bidding for him. Neither a young girl nor, probably, a fool. But I can see that it could be taken as meaning 'fool' with the 'The Monkey and the Cat' reference (Zayana being the monkey and Lessingham being the cat - or the Vicar being the cat and Lessingham his paw). The cat in the fable is not duped, but is in fact forced aganst his will to put his paw in the fire. Any number of definitions of the idiom 'Cat's Paw' gives 'a person used or exploited by another as a tool or dupe'.</p>\n\n<p>So basically I'm agreeing that Nannicock is a term of contempt and could possibly mean a 'fool' (from Edisson's quote) but I don't understand where they get 'Young girl' from. </p>\n\n<p>With Pillicock meaning penis, Meacock meaning 'effeminate' and 'nanny-hen' possibly meaning 'affected' (not natural) it's leading me to think Nannicock might actually mean something along the lines of 'transvestite' or 'rent-boy' or similar, although why Pepys would use that as the name of a cow that startled church-goers ... then again, that would be quite startling.</p>\n\n<p>I also note that the use of 'cock' to mean penis is documented from early 1600's so presumably in use before Breton's work and even if not, 'cock' to mean 'male' especially in birds, certainly was widespread at that time.</p>\n\n<p>So that leads me to the question:</p>\n\n<p>What definitions are there for the word Nannicock and what it's the etymology for each definition.</p>\n"},{"id":194799,"title":"Etymology of &quot;age of majority?&quot;","body":"<p>What is the etymology of the phrase \"age of majority,\" meaning, e.g., 18 in the US?
