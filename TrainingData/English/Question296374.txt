It means I gave her a picture of someone else. </p>\n\n<p>I've looked at the following page, but this type of usage doesn't seem to be covered there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1176/when-is-it-correct-to-use-yourself-and-myself-versus-you-and-me\">When is it correct to use “yourself” and “myself” (versus “you” and “me”)?</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answers there suggest that we use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object of the verb are the same entity. <em>Herself</em> isn't an object in the example above, and <em>Susie</em> is not a subject either. The syntax in this example seems to be entirely different.</p>\n\n<p>Also, why is the following sentence not grammatical?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>I went there by me.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... as opposed to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>I went there by myself. </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This last example, of course, is perfectly fine. So the question here is why does this so-called 'idiomatic usage' contain a reflexive instead of a normal pronoun.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, why is a reflexive required  in this imperative?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Do it yourself.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Compare with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Do it you.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that <em>yourself</em> isn't an object in that first sentence. (It would be if the sentence was <em>Watch yourself</em>, for example. The object in the example, however, is <em>it</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>What then are the grammatical rules that stipulate the use of reflexive pronouns in these examples?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit note</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I've changed the order of the examples here to take the focus off the probable emphatic usage in the imperative (although I'm still interested in the grammar here). I've also added a third example, which highlights more clearly the two issues I am most interested in hearing about:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Examples where we need a reflexive pronoun, but the pronoun isn't the object of a verb.</li>\n<li>Examples, where the <em>antecedent</em>, the original person or thing that the reflexive is duplicating,  is not the <em>subject</em> of a verb. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any answers with relevant observations and or research would be very gratefully received, whether they address the whole question, or just parts of it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Observations about the imperative example</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although I'm most concerned with the photograph example, I hereby offer some observations about the imperative one. Some of the interesting comments below suggest that <em>yourself</em> here is an emphatic version of <em>you</em>. As RegEdit's answer points out, the example with <em>yourself</em> seems to be contrastive. The sentence with <em>you</em>, on the other hand, does not give the same reading. I wonder why that is? </p>\n\n<p>I note in passing that <em>yourself</em> seems to be an adjunct ('adverbial') here. This makes it different from another emphatic use of pronouns, which is when a pronoun appears as the subject of an imperative: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>You</em> do it! </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I originally gave the imperative example for two reasons. Firstly, the reflexive pronoun here is obviously not the object of the verb. Secondly, however, I gave it because there is no antecedent <em>word</em> in this sentence which could be the <em>subject</em> of the verb, or, which represents the same person as <em>yourself</em>. I am curious as to whether the rules requiring reflexive pronouns in emphatic usages, are basically the same ones that require us to use them the rest of the time. In other words, I return to my original question: Why is  a reflexive pronoun required in this case?</p>\n"},{"id":177243,"title":"&quot;Of which many&quot; vs &quot;many of which&quot; as parenthetical modifiers","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>The houses on Canal street, of which many had been damaged in the storm, looked abandoned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is the modifier \"of which many... storm\" correct?</p>\n\n<p>I know that \"on canal street\" is a prepositional phrase so it cannot be the antecedent of \"which\".\nalso, I can say that \"of which many... storm\" is a subgroup modifier which modifies \"houses.\"</p>\n\n<p>But I doubt whether the modifier is properly used.
