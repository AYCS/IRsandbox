He is so in love/head over heels for her.</p>\n\n<p>Also, and this is my question, father's say, my children are the lobes of my liver. It is a figurative phrase meaning 'my beloved everything'. A person can live without a portion of his liver, unlike his heart, but with many complications. The liver is an important organ. Maybe the father if he lost one of his liver lobes/one of his children, something will always embitter him in life, maybe that is where it comes from. Is there a common thing which children are described as in english by there parents?</p>\n\n<p>Example:\nArabic poetry:\nThe incoming air, brought along the scent of my homeland, \nThe land of my forefathers,\nWhere fuelled fire of malice burnt my liver lobes.</p>\n"}]}]
