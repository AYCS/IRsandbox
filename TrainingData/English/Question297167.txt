[{"id":297167,"title":"What is the Auditory Analog of Picturing Something","body":"<p>My wife has a song stuck in her head and I don't know the song, though I know I have heard it, since it is from a film we've both seen.</p>\n\n<p>If it was a image, I would say 'I can't picture that.' What is the analogous way to express that nothing comes to mind when I attempt to recall sound? Obviously, I could say exactly that, but I mean something analogous to the single word 'picture' as a verb. This question is sparked by the fact my actual response to her was 'I can't picture that song,' but of course I can't picture a song. No one can picture a song unless they have synesthesia. </p>\n\n<p>I tried looking on Google and the closest that came up was the use of the term 'sonification' as analogous to 'visualization,' but I believe that was just made up for someone's PhD thesis (it definitely does not seem correct to say I can't 'sonify' a song). I suppose I could just say 'I don't remember what it sounds like,' which is perfectly correct, but I'm wondering if there is a more succinct way to express this idea for senses other than vision.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":275285,"title":"Something describing a fully-fledged idea, full-blown","body":"<p>I'm looking for a word, or concise phrase that describes something. (So, this isn't just a single-word-request, and I'm unsure how to tag it.)</p>\n\n<p>First, some examples of things that are close, but may not quite be what I'm trying to describe:</p>\n\n<p>Visual artists (painters, sculptors, etc), often get a vision of something, then try to render their vision concrete using a medium and/or particular style.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"When Michelangelo looked at the block of marble he was to carve he looked beyond the outside and saw the shape of the statue he was about to create.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Musicians often have a 'sound' (or melody) in their head, that they try to make real.</p>\n\n<p>(I can't find the good quote I recall):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"You will never come on anything in nature that sounds like a symphony.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, for those artists it's not unusual to say that what they're aiming for is fully-formed in their head (yes, I realize not all visual or sound (aural? auditory?) art is created this way).  The only problem the artists with these visions encounter is the time, labor, and the struggle with materials and technique to get something close to their vision out into reality.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But it <strong>is</strong> unusual, but not unheard of, for authors to get something like this artistic vision.  Sometimes the muse (or monkey on their back) is beating down the doors - and things blossom, fully-formed - just sitting in their head, just waiting to come out - they <em>flow</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Well, The Princess Bride opened itself to me. I never had a writing experience like it. ... and it all just came out.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The first time I wrote a real play, I was in college, eating breakfast, and heard a single line of dialogue echoing over and over in my mind.  Intrigued, I moved to the typewriter (yes, it was that long ago) and took dictation (there's no other word for it) for two straight hours during which the characters, their plight, and every aspect of the drama was thrown at me at blazing speed without a moment of hesitation, doubt, or contemplative thought.  The play (a one-act) was produced in college, produced professionally, and hardly a line changed from that first astounding burst.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A word that doesn't quite capture this experience: Promethean (the experience or result doesn't have to be boldly creative, which Promethean implies).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>@vstrong has mentioned, and I have thought of describing it as Athenian, but is that a recognized/popular meaning for that word (is that word popularly used, even)?  If I use that word, are most literate people going to understand my meaning - or are they going to have to derive it from their knowledge of Greek/Roman myth (scanty in this day and age) and contextual clues?  Because mostly, when I run across that word, I associate that with residents of Athens, Greece - and I have a fair grounding in myth, which it seems most people do not.</p>\n"},{"id":70167,"title":"What is the Tacoma Narrows bridge doing in this picture?","body":"<p>When the plate of the bridge assumes the unnatural shape showed in the following picture, what is this phenomenon called? <strong>Contortion</strong> (example: <em>the bridge was contorting ...</em>).
