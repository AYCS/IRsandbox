It's just amazing and extremely accessible, really a perfect complement to Practical English Usage by Swan. </p>\n\n<p>But only one thing I still feel uncertain about is whether <strong>could</strong> can be used alone without adding \"if-clause\" to express irrealis thoughts.

Our team <strong>might</strong> still win the race can\n    be paraphrased ‘It is barely possible that…’ or ‘It is possible,\n    though unlikely, …’.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Meaning and the English Verb §186 </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>To conclude, the following sentences illustrate this multiplicity with examples of <strong>seven different</strong> meanings of <strong>could</strong>:</p>\n    \n    <p>#1, #2 and #3 are omitted here.<br>\n     #4. Hypothetical equivalent of can (= ‘possibility’) (cf. §176)<br>\n     The house is one of the most beautiful that <strong>could</strong> be imagined.<br>\n     #5. Hypothetical equivalent of can (= ‘ability’) (cf. §176)<br>\n     Do you know anyone who <strong>could</strong> repair this clock for me?<br>\n     #6.

Isn't the usage of <strong>could</strong> in the three examples in §183 identical with that in #7?

Is the usage of #7 derived form #4 or #5?\nFor #4 and #5.
