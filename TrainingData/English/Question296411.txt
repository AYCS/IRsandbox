Which of these is a better alternative to referring to one as stupid?","body":"<p>I am attempting to formulate a phrase that is an exceptional alternative to the banal \"stupid\". I have found some good contestants, but I feel that exiguous, if I am using it correctly, will fit the best for my taste. So far, I am attempting to decide among the following phrases:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Intellectually impaired\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Intellectually deficient\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Intellectually meager\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Intellectually inferior\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Intellectually exiguous\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Example usage/real scenario (reason for which this question was asked):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Who can use the most Propaganda in their advertisement without the intellectually [chosen word] majority noticing?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here's where the first question appears. Is \"exiguous\" used correctly in the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Who can use the most Propaganda in their advertisement without the intellectually exiguous majority noticing?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The taste that I previously referenced to was that of my perception of the word that best fits the above example. I was looking for a phrase whose meaning is, essentially, \"stupid\", but whose wording cannot be confused with something similar to \"mentally handicapped\" or \"mentally challenged\" with substantial ease. I suppose that when one closely analyzes the meaning of \"stupid\", it's almost inevitable that it'll be in affiliation with some mental disability. In the case that we completely disregard that, though, which of the phrases listed above would be the best fit for my situation? I'm almost certain I'd pick \"exiguous\". If I'm incorrectly using \"exiguous\" and I cannot use it, what would be the next best option to pick? Lastly, as a final request, are there any other alternative phrases similar to those listed above meaning \"stupid\" that you know or can fabricate?</p>\n"},{"id":106036,"title":"Referring to people from different parts of United Kingdom","body":"<p>I see four people in front of me. One is from Wales, one is from Scotland, one is from England and one is from Northern Ireland. I can say about each one \"He is Scottish/Welsh/English\". But, how do I say it about all of them? As far as I heard, Great Britain is the island, so I cannot say \"They are British\" because that would exclude the man from Northern Ireland. \"They are United Kingdomers\"... I doubt that it is correct.

No that isn't quite the word is it? Because had Penelope understood the reason she would have been as sympathetic as the next person. It was just that it simply never occurred to Penelope that her guest might be feeling sad about something, that she, the guest was not able to talk about.
