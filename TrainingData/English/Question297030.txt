Also, they will sometimes say \"I need to / must cooperate with my customers.\"  This usage seems to support my idea of the word, however when I ask for further details they don't feel \"unwilling\" to work with customers.

I've been helping a friend to learn English and one of her questions has me stumped, even as a native speaker. She is confused about which verb forms to use.

And then, later, gunned a few of them down. Why isn't this act called ‘terrorism’ and why isn't he called a ‘terrorist’? I have never seen the words <em>terrorist</em> or <em>terrorism</em> used to  refer to these people or their acts in the media. Does the mass media knowingly omit these words due to sentimental reasons (considering the family of the murderer or something like that)? Or is it because it's inappropriate to use those words? </p>\n\n<p>I've come to learn that the word <em>terrorism</em> is from the French, <em>terrorisme</em>, which is derived from the Latin verb <em>terreō</em> meaning “I frighten”. I believe then it is apt for the above mentioned situation. Does the word <em>terrorism</em> actually refer to an act committed by a group of people? And is that why the terms are not used in the above explained situation?
