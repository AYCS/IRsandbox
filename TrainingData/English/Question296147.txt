For instance if I type in <em>alien</em> it will show me the word <em>salient</em>. That dictionary should base on the sound itself, not just the word list.

Does it perhaps depend on their etymology? Maybe if both meanings can be traced to the same root they are one word and if they derive from different sources they are two? Alternatively, how are words defined? Is it in terms of spelling, of meaning, of origin or a combination of the three?
