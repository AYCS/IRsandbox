[{"id":91506,"title":"Word for the behavior of people who complain at everything you do","body":"<p>I usually tend to see the behavior in which someone takes an action, and people criticize, and even suggest what they should have done, yet when they take that same suggestion people still criticize.</p>\n\n<p>For instance: I'm slim; when I eat with my family, everyone exclaims at the amount of food I'm eating. When I eat normally, they ask \"Don't you know, you should eat more so you can grow better?\" When I don't eat, the same shouting takes place. So in other words, is there a word I could use to describe them or their behavior in this regard?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":91463,"title":"Word for a person who continually tries to teach you when it&#39;s not necessary","body":"<p>I've experienced this way too many times, and the best example I can give is a person who treats you like you have no idea how to do X and who keeps teaching you how to do it.

However, there is a person always insists on explaining the game to you - like you are always new to the game - when you don't actually need any help and you just want to think for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Another example situation is doing a repetitive task which you already have experience with, and yet the person continually tries to 'teach' you when you don't need help/already know how to do it.
