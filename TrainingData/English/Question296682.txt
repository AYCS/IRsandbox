There are a lotSo much so that now it all looks like a jumble of which adjectives sound better with ‘and’ in between or sound good in reverse order. In fact, reversing the order of adjectives don't help my brain at all, like the following example from <em>New Hart’s Rules</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>thin, long piece of wood</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, ‘long, thin piece of wood’ feels unnatural to me, yet a comma is required since ‘thin and long piece’ sounds good. Of course, reversing the order and using ‘and’ are just <em>tests</em> for helping you decide—the real reasons need lengthier explanations.</p>\n\n<p>And that is the reason for this post—the difference in explanation of <em>New Hart’s Rules</em>, <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> and the rest of the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>The various articles on the Internet give the same information as <em>CMOS</em>—<strong>coordinate adjectives</strong> need a comma between them, as they are modifying the following noun independently, and <strong>cumulative adjectives</strong> don't need a comma.</p>\n\n<p>But <em>NHR</em> gives a completely different set of rules and terms, though mostly arriving at the same conclusion of when to use a comma:</p>\n\n<p>Coordinate and cumulative adjectives are not mentioned at all. What we have are <strong>gradable</strong> or <strong>qualitative adjectives</strong> and <strong>classifying adjectives</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Two gradable/qualitative adj. need comma in between. Two classifying adj. or one classifying with gradable/qualitative adj. don’t need a comma. It also mentions a test: use of ‘very’ is possible with gradable and qualitative adjectives as they have comparative and superlative forms. This test doesn't work with classifying adjectives.</p>\n\n<p>So, please share your thoughts on why Oxford doesn’t explain adjective-comma issue the way <em>CMOS</em> does. Are they talking about exactly the same kind of adjectives with the same logic, or is it just coincidence that they end up with similar decisions? What are your personal gripes and solutions in deciding for a comma between more complex and unusual adjectives?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> E.g. <em>horny, toothless beak</em>: It feels normal to say ‘horny and toothless beak’, but by the rules of <em>NHR</em>, ‘toothless’ is a classifying adjective, hence a comma is not required.

For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We decided to go to the grocery store, rather than a restaurant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the above sentence, the comma seems to be unnatural and incorrect. I can only think that perhaps they were taught to always use a comma before \"rather than\" when it is used in an appositive phrase, as such:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We decided that, rather than going out to a restaurant, we would go to the grocery store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This usage is correct, and I have no problem with it. I <strong>think</strong> that people use the comma in the first example because they are incorrectly applying a rule that should only apply to parenthetical phrases. They might decide that the last part of the sentence is a parenthetical phrase because it is nonessential information, but if you replaced the words \"rather than\" with \"instead of,\" few people would put a comma there. It just doesn't flow properly.</p>\n\n<p>However, the incidence of English teachers perpetuating the first example is so great that I have to wonder if I have missed a lesson somewhere.
