Due to the nature of 911, every event is the worst thing that has ever happened to that patient, at that particular time.

Whatever you choose to be is beautiful and flawless regardless of anyone else’s opinion. Be proud of whatever you choose to be. No matter what you choose to be, there will be people that try to bring you down and there will be people that try to bring you up. You should always be proud of being you; be proud of what you look like, be proud of how you act, be proud of how you walk, be proud of how you talk, be proud of how you dress, be proud of your sexuality, just be proud of anything you have. These are all beautiful characteristics you have that set yourself different from everyone else. If you have a big nose, rock that big nose, be proud of your big nose, never be ashamed of your big nose; a big nose isn’t ugly, a big nose is a beautiful trait that you have.  Never put yourself down because you envy a characteristic that another person possesses. You have characteristics they don’t have and they probably envy you for it as well. People might call your characteristics “ugly”, people might call your lifestyle “wrong”, people might  say what you do is “gross”  but regardless of what other people think, you and what you do are beautiful because you are you. What society wants doesn’t matter, you be whatever you want to be. Be eccentric, be dull, be exciting, be extraordinary, be yourself, it’s your life, not society’s life. You make the rules of how to live your life, not society. What society thinks doesn’t matter, you’re just being happy being yourself and living life however you want. Your opinion of yourself shouldn’t be hindered by anyone else, your opinion is your opinion, not society’s opinion, not your family’s opinion, and not your friends’ opinion; it is your opinion.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I apologize if this website is not meant for checking like this.</p>\n"},{"id":105413,"title":"Comma or semicolon?","body":"<p>Which of the following is correct?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>This not only produces higher success rates, it increases our energy and morale instead of depleting them.</li>\n  <li>This not only produces higher success rates; it increases our energy and morale instead of depleting them.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":94773,"title":"Comma or Semicolon","body":"<p>I'm wondering if the comma placed after <em>event</em> is being used appropriately or if it should be replaced with a semicolon.
