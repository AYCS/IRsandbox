For them real Beauty is altogether a more profound entity and is aligned with Truth, the truth of a unified Reality waiting to be revealed. Of course there is a paradox at the heart of this belief. Scientists are examining the material world of real things working in particular ways. But even if they start out simply making observations, whether of stars, fishes or brain cells, they cannot resist looking for patterns, which leads to the positing of empirically or logically provable hypotheses. If these start out on the level of ‘just supposing’, in the most rigorous practice the Popperian system is brought into play, attempting by replicable experiment to disprove them until there is sufficient evidence remaining which cannot be disproved, and which, therefore, may point to the right answer for the time being. Scientists know that while breakthroughs are hailed, paradigms shift. And yet, even if their task is to observe change itself, as in dynamic systems or as a consequence of entropy or environmental breakdown; moreover, even while many will claim to have no religious affiliations and to be robustly atheist or agnostic, the majority express a faith in the notion of an absolute knowledge which demands a high order of visionary thinking.\n  <sub>Art and Science By Sîan Ede</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":257242,"title":"what is &quot;that...&quot; referring to?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>In his book <em>Unweaving the Rainbow</em>, Richard Dawkins challenges the view expressed in Romantic poetry <strong>that the desire to analyse the workings of the world through examining its smallest components is merely to make a ‘dull catalogue of common things’</strong>.
