[{"id":297054,"title":"Does the word &#39;hard boiled&#39; have a positive connotation?","body":"<p>Upon a quick google search '<a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hard-boiled%20meaning\" rel=\"nofollow\">hard-boiled</a>' means tough and cynical even though it doesn't say that this is a disapproving term. One of the synonyms of this word is '<a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/?gws_rd=ssl#q=hardened%20meaning\" rel=\"nofollow\">hardened</a>' which means 'very experienced in a particular job or activity and therefore not easily upset by its more unpleasant aspects' which seems like an admirable quality to have for likes of a soldier, militant or an inspector. But such a person would be labelled callous or uncaring about other people's feelings which is confusing me as this is unlikable quality to possess.
