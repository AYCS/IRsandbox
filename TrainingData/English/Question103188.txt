For the case of <em>k</em> = 2, as in <em>½-regular</em>, it is naturally pronounced and written <em>half-regular</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, I am now dealing with the ⅓‑regular case, and I’m surprised to find that saying <em>third-regular</em> doesn’t sound right at all!</p>\n\n<p>After considering for a while, I realized that using <strong>ordinals</strong> to denote fractions here always sounds wrong, but that when there is a different word, it works. For instance, saying <em>quarter-regular</em> for <em>¼-regular</em> sounds fine, but  <em>fourth-regular</em> does not.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to a couple of related questions. In my US-based usage, I would have assumed that <em>quarter</em> and <em>fourth</em> were perfect synonyms for describing fractions.

Does the difference lie solely in whether or not the word can be used as a prefix? </p>\n\n<p>For instance, saying a <em>quarter-full glass</em> sounds fine, while saying a <em>fourth-full glass</em> does not, because when pronounced out loud it sounds like you have four full glasses and are referencing the fourth of these.
