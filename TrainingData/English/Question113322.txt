The elements are supposed to be stacked and displayed in \"succession\" but I was only seeing the last element (that was stored in succession to the previous element(s) that was strangely extant).

I want to specify that the \"order\" of elements don't \"stretch back\" from the one's displayed. Now I hadn't hoped to expect that the Programmers at Microsoft are \"linguistic morons\". The correct word usage may be essential in their coming with the accurate response ye?</p></li>\n<li><p>here it is Trevor. Well what I meant was this:\nthe clipboard programme is supposed to list out all the clipboard elements in order of their employment. so imagine the carriages of a train, starting from the engine (if the engine is the \"middle\" carriage). there are 5 carriages before/behind the engine and 5 after/in front of the engine. in my case, the problem is not the carriages in front of the engine, but the carriages behind the engine. I want the programmers to know that the carriages behind the engine are not displayed, and not just \"displayed\", but they are not displayed in the way they should: in order. or the backward order. now is there a word for backward order? \"reverse order\" could be a solution, but is there a word, an antonym for the forward flow of things, or \"succession\". there. cheers!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>counter-successive sounds perfect thanks indeed Kris.
