[{"id":297027,"title":"Word Hunt: Audio Player Terminology","body":"<p>I'm looking for a few words today, in the context of Audio Players. I'm basically looking for words that match the following definitions:</p>\n\n<p>Here are my current known words, and their definitions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Player</strong> - The Audio Player itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Buffer</strong> - The Audio that has been loaded/stream already for the User</li>\n<li><strong>Play Button</strong> - The Button that Plays, Pauses, and Resumes the Audio.</li>\n<li><strong>Volume</strong> - The amplitude of the Audio.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And here's my definitions that need words:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Needle?</strong> - The Marker that represents the current position <em>(time)</em> in the Song.\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hLP4j.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hLP4j.png\" alt=\"Needle\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Time?</strong> - A term meaning \"The current position <em>(time)</em> in the song\".\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lpBJg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lpBJg.png\" alt=\"Time\"></a></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Track?</strong> - A term meaning the entire time, buffer, needle, etc. mashed up into a widget.\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SVVmj.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SVVmj.png\" alt=\"Track\"></a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The words I've provided are mere suggestions. I'm here asking about these because they just don't seem right. <strong>Needle</strong> could be <strong>Marker</strong>, <strong>Indicator</strong>, <strong>Position</strong>, <strong>Slider</strong>, etc.; <strong>Time</strong> could be <strong>Position</strong>, <strong>Length</strong>, etc.; and <strong>Track</strong> could <strong>Slider</strong>, <strong>Widget</strong>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I would prefer terms that are used when talking about Music, or Audio Devices. Generic terms like <strong>Time</strong> could have many meanings. And <strong>Needle</strong> doesn't really describe the object in question, as it's not really a 'needle' <em>(Metallic, pointy object)</em>.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":293338,"title":"Word for playing the music purely and unpurely","body":"<p>I am looking for adjectives/adverbs that express the quality and the extent to which the melody of a musical performance adheres to the prescribed composition.</p>\n\n<p>For example,  A4 has a frequency of 440Hz.

For instance, if you hear someone play an E♭ by itself on a piano it doesn't contain any particular \"feel\" (eg. it may not make you sad, or happy, or invoke any particular emotion). However, if you listen to an entire song in the key of E♭, then stop, then play a solo E♭ it may sound as if the note has taken on the \"mood\" of the song (eg. it might sound sad if you had just been listening to a sad song and E♭ was in the key that the song was in).</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, I'm looking for the word (it might be the same) for when this particular form of bias effects \"normal\" sounds. eg. you play a song in the key of E♭, and then pick up a glass of water and hear ice clinking, if the note of the ice happens to be in the same key as the song you were playing the ice may then \"sound\" like the song and invoke the same feeling.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard several people talk about percieving things this way, but I've never known anyone to have a word for it.</p>\n"},{"id":173444,"title":"Word for &quot;A Song that Sets a Scene in a Particular Region or Culture&quot;","body":"<p>This is a technical term in theater and movie arts for a stereotyped piece of music that is played to cue the audience that a scene is set in a particular location. </p>\n\n<p>E.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>London --&gt; Rule Britannia\nItaly --&gt; O sole Mio\nGerman --&gt; Oompah music\nNew York/Broadway --&gt; No Business like Show business\n</code></pre>\n"},{"id":266128,"title":"Word for unconventional performance in playing instruments?","body":"<p>A whoa-dude performance performs by Salut Salon: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKezUd_xw20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Competitive Foursome</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZnepU.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZnepU.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It uses abnormal playing positions in the instruments, while keeping the high level of speed and accuracy of the music.
