I do not want to know if nested flashbacks are okay. I am simply asking about tense. Thanks for the help! Question is below:</p>\n\n<p>Should a flashback be written in past tense?

Judiada, I . . .

Lāza’s still out there.” Walking in circles, Samt grabbed his sun-streaked, shoulder length hair in frustration and said, “He was here getting ready. Here. I just talked to him!” He stopped and looked at Judiada. “Doi minu teelio!” Three weeks ago!” Samt took a seat and remembered his last conversation with Lāza.</p>\n\n<p>Three weeks earlier . . .</p>\n\n<p>(Flashback 2 past perfect tense)</p>\n\n<p>Samt had grown tired of listening to the takeoff and landings of spacecrafts while standing in the control room. His anxiousness had turned into boredom while he waited to talk with his superior, Lāza Holmes. Lāza was to set off for his next voyage after their meeting. </p>\n\n<p>Samt looked at the numeral box and noticed that Lāza was beyond late. Samt packed his carrying bag and then headed to the door. He decided that he’d wait to talk to Lāza after he completed his mission. Samt opened the door and before he could walk out, Lāza was walking onto the space carrier deck. </p>\n"},{"id":204398,"title":"Tricky Past Perfect sentences","body":"<p>I'm having trouble establishing a sequence of events in the following sentences (<em>italicized</em>) and understanding why the past perfect is needed.</p>\n\n<p>\"<em>Once upon a time, when I <strong>was</strong> a child reading fairy tales, <strong>I’d ached</strong> to have my own adventures.</em> Not that I’d wanted to be some dippy heroine languishing in a tower, awaiting rescue. No, I’d wanted to be the knight, charging into battle against overwhelming odds, or the plucky country lass who gets taken on as an apprentice to a great wizard. <em>As I <strong>got older</strong>, <strong>I’d found out</strong> the hard way that adventures are rarely anything like the books say.</em> Half the time you are scared out of your mind, and the rest you’re bored and your feet hurt.

Can I use \"for\" and \"since\" with past continuous while I'm talking past unrelated to present, or are those used solely with perfect tenses?
