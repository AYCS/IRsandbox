[{"id":285687,"title":"Origin of &quot;How are you?&quot;","body":"<p>I'm currently researching different greetings for a linguistics project and I'm having trouble finding information as to the history of the phrase, \"How are you,\" or those of equivalent structures. I noticed one post (<a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/188517/what-are-the-origins-of-hi-hey-hello\">what are the origins of hi, hey, hello?</a>) which is a step in the right direction, but doesn't quite answer my question.</p>\n\n<p>For my project, we want to compare and contrast greetings in different languages. For example, in English we may say, \"How are you?\" or, \"How do you do?\" when first greeting someone, whereas in Mandarin, it is common to say, \"Have you eaten?\" - \"吃了吗\" (google translate, hope it's right!)</p>\n\n<p>When I first heard this I was surprised, to say the least. I thought it an odd expression for when you first greet somebody. Likewise when my Chinese friends were learning English they said they found it difficult to answer the expression, \"How are you?\" and when they asked, I said I wasn't really sure either....</p>\n\n<p>When we are asked \"How are you\", we nearly never respond to the question with a genuine answer. In fact one of the only situations where it seems to make sense is deep in conversation or where pragmatics suggests something other than \"I'm fine.\" So, Why don't we say something a bit more concrete for greetings like, \"have you eaten?\" which has an answer that is a bit more tangible. To me it actually seems to make a bit more sense!</p>\n\n<p>So why is it that we say, \"how are you?\" and where does it come from? When did this greeting start to gain traction and what other greetings did it replace (if any)? How do you respond to this when asked?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":16312,"title":"Do you really answer &quot;How do you do?&quot; with &quot;How do you do?&quot;","body":"<p>We're told in our English classes (learning English as a foreign language) that the only possible answer to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>How do you do?</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is to repeat the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>How do you do?</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(While it's perfectly OK to answer other similar questions</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>How are you? / How are you doing?</li>\n  <li>Fine, thanks / etc</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>)</p>\n\n<p>That said, then I talk to English speakers with Skype or in chats, I tried to ask the question, but the answer was never \"how do you do?\".

I guess the following situation would fall under the category of \"being asked by a shop assistant\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A little while ago I was visiting a US agency in a European country. There was an American man at a counter serving people. Each time a new person came in, the man would greet him/her with something like \"Hi, how are you?\" and a smile. Most people responded with just \"good\" or \"fine\". When my turn came, I responded with \"I'm fine, thank you. How are <em>you</em>?\". I could see the man was a bit surprised, but quickly recovered and replied he is doing fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When someone asks you \"How are you?\", he is probably not genuinely interested in how exactly are you doing.
