It is not created by reduplication process but a pattern is reduplicated when you use the plural form. He also noted that <em>testis, testes</em> follows a specific Latin declension in which singular <em>-is</em> is replaced with plural <em>-es</em>. Some other nouns belonging to the same declension: <em>axis, axes; thesis, theses; oasis, oases.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplication\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia definition</a> of <em>reduplication</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reduplication in linguistics is a morphological process in which <strong>the root or stem of a word (or part of it)</strong> or even the whole word is repeated exactly or with a slight change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The definition says that the repeated part can even be part of the root or stem of a word. I know that the word <em>testes</em> is not created with the usual reduplication process but there is also a form called <em>inflectional reduplication</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A still stricter definition of reduplication would only include inflectional reduplication, i.e., only a\n  reduplication which serves a clear-cut grammatical function, is to be considered an 'actual' form\n  of reduplication, thereby excluding lexical reduplicate forms. Inflectional reduplication, is\n  however probably the most uncommon of all forms of reduplication. Inflectional reduplication is\n  manifested either as a full reduplication or as a partial reduplication, i.e., the copying of only a\n  part of the base.</p>\n  \n  <p><sub>Source: <a href=\"http://reduplication.uni-graz.at/texte/Other_Red_Phen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://reduplication.uni-graz.at/texte/Other_Red_Phen.pdf</a></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can someone please shed light on this?</p>\n\n<p><sub>Note: <em>Testes</em> is also one of the plural forms of <em>test</em> meaning \"The cupel used in treating gold or silver alloys or ore; now esp. the cupel, with the iron frame or basket which contains it, forming the movable hearth of a reverberatory furnace\" <em>[OED]</em></sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another controversial word is <em>tartar</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For the proper noun <em>Tartar</em> (meaning \"a native inhabitant of the region of central Asia extending eastward from the Caspian Sea, and formerly known as Independent and Chinese Tartary.\" <em>OED</em>), the book \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland\" has the following:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Iemic.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Iemic.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n"},{"id":205554,"title":"Are there many words that come with “a” as the prefix to mean “no, non” like “asymptomatic” and “apolitical”?","body":"<p>I didn’t know the word, “asymptomatic” to my shame, until I heard the following narration in AP Radio news aired on October 27 through AFN network:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Dr. Anthony Fauci with the NIH says CDC guidelines for monitoring\n  health workers back from West Africa are enough to prevent them from\n  spreading the disease. “Guidelines regarding how you handle people who\n  coming back should always be based on the science, and the science\n  tells us that people who are <strong>asymptomatic</strong> do not transmit.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I took ‘asymptomatic’ as ‘a symptomatic,’ when my friend in ESS corrected me and told that it’s ‘asymptomatic’ accompanied with prefix “a” meaning “no, non.” </p>\n\n<p>She was right, then I asked her other examples of the words using negative prefix “a,” which I later found Greek origin. \nShe said she knew some, but can’t reel off them off-hand.
