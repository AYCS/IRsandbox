[{"id":297223,"title":"A more common term for &quot;rabbit cold.&quot;","body":"<p>I've been quoting <em>Lolita</em> (as well as <em>Don Juan</em>, <em>Man and Superman</em>, <em>Pygmalion</em>, <em>Tom Jones</em>, and various Mark Twain's witticisms) for a while now; some people might be annoyed by this, but I don't care anymore, for reasons that should be obvious to some people here):</p>\n\n<p>From <em>Lolita</em> by Vladimir Nabokov:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>She sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger. The fog of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity. Oh, she had changed! Her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture, what pustulate epidermis comes in contact with her skin. Its smooth tender bloom had been so lovely in former days, so bright with tears, when I used to roll, in play, her tousled head on my knee. A coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence. What was locally known as a <strong>\"rabbit cold</strong>\" had painted with flaming pink the edges of her contemptuous nostrils. As in terror I lowered my gaze, it mechanically slid along the underside of her tensely stretched bare thigh—how polished and muscular her legs had grown! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way it's dashingly described, the condition is instantly recognizable in the sentence (let's give the author that, he is an artist, not just a linguist). </p>\n\n<p>But.

The Russian translation of the same novel (penned by Nabokov himself) has it as \"кроличья простуда\", which, I'm told, is the exact same thing, and a quick google search on it turns up the exact same useless slew of references to sick rabbits and various methods of treating them as the original. </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":276177,"title":"Does the term &quot;prose&quot; have stylistic connotations?","body":"<p>I am trying to find a good word to refer to \"colloquial, free-flowing speech formatted in paragraphs.\" I believe the word for this is \"prose\" but I am concerned that this word has stylistic connotations and that I'm not using it correctly.
