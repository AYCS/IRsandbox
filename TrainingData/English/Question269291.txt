Now, while I have found plenty of synonyms for the male body parts, I'm having difficulties with the female ones. For some reason, all synonyms in the English language for \"vagina\" sound rather off-putting. </p>\n\n<p>I cannot use \"vulva\" because it sounds too clinical (same with \"vagina\"). \"Womb\" makes me think of motherhood (which is the last thing I want to come to the readers' minds while reading these scenes) or animals. \"Gash\" sounds like it would be better used to describe flesh wounds. \"Hole\" sounds very ominous and generic. Other words like \"pussy\" or \"c*nt\" are too slang-ish, even offensive. And euphemism like \"love cave\" or \"Cupid's hole\" or anything along those lines sound very childish and even humorous. I was considering \"slit\" for a while but even that brings slang to mind.
