Kipling is talking to a man named Gobind. \"Even so\" occurs five parapgraphs down.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‘And what,’ said Gobind one Sunday afternoon, ‘is your honoured craft, and by what manner of means earn you your daily bread?’</p>\n  \n  <p>‘I am,’ said I, ‘a kerani – one who writes with a pen upon paper, not being in the service of the Government.’</p>\n  \n  <p>‘Then what do you write?’ said Gobind. ‘Come nearer, for I cannot see your countenance, and the light fails.’</p>\n  \n  <p>‘I write about all matters that lie within my understanding, and of many that are not. But chiefly I write of Life and Death, and of men and women, and Love and Fate according to the measure of my ability, telling the tale through the mouths of one, two, or more people. Then by the favour of God money accrues to me that I may keep alive.’</p>\n  \n  <p>'<strong>Even so</strong>,' said Gobind. 'That is the work of the bazar story−teller; but he speaks straight to men and women and does not write anything at all. Only when the tale has aroused expectation, and calamities are about to befall the virtuous, he stops suddenly and demands payment ere he continues the narration. Is it so in your craft, my son?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, it is a full stop after “ ‘Even so,’ said Gobind.” So it looks a thought it means something other than “nevertheless” or “that being the case.\" Can anyone help?</p>\n\n<p>There is another instance in the same book, in “Little Tobrah. Little Tobrah has just mentioned a little sister. Then it goes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‘She who was found dead in the well?’ said one who had heard something of the trial. ‘Even so,’ said Little Tobrah gravely. ‘She who was found dead in the well.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, I think it clearly means “yes” or “exactly.” Can anyone help me with the first quote? Kipling often puts unusual, somewhat archaic, I think, constructions in the mouth of Indians. It is possibly the case here.</p>\n"},{"id":261559,"title":"What is the meaning of &quot;phantastic&quot; and what does a dated form of a word mean?","body":"<p>I recently saw this word used in <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/a/116023/27149\">a Android SE post</a> and at first I thought the user misspelt the word but actually I found that a word \"phantastic\" exists. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.yourdictionary.com/phantastic\" rel=\"nofollow\">phantastic meaning of yourdictionary</a> website tells its the dated version of the word fantastic.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yourdictionary.com/phantastic\" rel=\"nofollow\">phantastic</a> - Adjective\n(comparative more phantastic, superlative most phantastic)</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't properly understand when we should actually use the word.
