The noun and verb <em>to kip</em> in BrEng is often said when a person wishes to take a <em>short sleep</em> or a <strong><em>quick nap</em></strong>.

Surprisingly, <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=kip&amp;searchmode=none\">Etymonline</a> completely ignores the word, listing only <em>kipper</em>. <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kip#Etymology_2\">Wiktionary</a> on the other hand comes to the rescue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>1760–70</strong>, probably related to Danish <em>kippe</em> (“dive, hovel, cheap inn”) and Middle Low German <em>kiffe</em> (“hovel”).

It’s a\n  marginally common verb, meaning ‘tilt’ or ‘lop’ (or ‘dip’ as in\n  ‘dipping the flag’), but according to the dictionary, the noun and the\n  verb are unrelated. The noun is allegedly the same as kipe ‘basket for\n  carrying grain’. Supposedly, the shift from ‘basket’ to ‘hovel’ was\n  helped along by Middle Low German kiffe ‘hut’, whence it was used in\n  compounds to refer specifically to a real dive or a brothel, which is\n  when English presumably borrowed (?) it. Quite a shaky etymology\n  overall, I’d say</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So on my trek to find the truth, I came across the <em><a href=\"http://books.google.it/books?id=Y0VaAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=dictionary++kip&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q3d4U8eJIsmr7AbK94HIBA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dictionary%20%20kip&amp;f=false\">Chinese-English Dictionary of the vernacular or spoken language of Amoy</a></em> by Carstairs Douglas, printed in 1873, London. The language Amoy or otherwise known as  Xiamenese, Xiamen or Hokkien dialect, I believe gives some insight as to how <em><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kip#Etymology_2\">kip</a></em> was loaned to the British English language to mean a short sleep or nap. It says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Kip</strong> [R. hasty; urgent; in extremity].<br>\n   <strong>tioh-kip</strong>, in very great haste; not willing to wait a moment, as in some very urgent matter.<br>\n  <strong>kip-kip</strong>, very swift, like the demon of thunder [...] said also figuratively of anything to be done in great haste.<br>\n   <strong>kip-sio</strong>, a small thin flat-bottomed earthen kettle for warming things quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Could it be that Dutch sailors adopted this expression? I am blissfully unaware of Danish maritime history but I seem to remember reading somewhere that the Dutch traded with the Chinese, was it the 13th century or later? This in turn reminds me of the Italian explorer Marco Polo and his tales in China in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Travels_of_Marco_Polo\"><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em></a> or, in Italian <em>Il Milione</em> (\"The Million\").

It is named <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> (Norwegian rat) which is a misnomer because the English naturalist John Berkenhout gave the binomial name, believing it had migrated to England from Norwegian ships in 1728 (which is disproven later.)</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of 19th century, the etymology of <em>brown rat</em> was better understood and the following note is mentioned in \"Natural History\" <em>by American scholar Alfred Henry Miles</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The brown rat is the species common in England, and best known throughout the world. <strong>It is said to have travelled from Persia to England less than two hundred years ago</strong> and to have spread from thence to other countries visited by English ships</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This finding gives a hint that the origin of the word <em>rat</em> might be of <em>Persian</em> origin (and also <em>Sanskrit</em>)<a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rat\"> [Wiktionary</a> puts as \"Middle Persian <em>randītan</em> (“to scrape, smooth”), Sanskrit <em>rádati</em> (“he gnaws, cuts”)).\"] </p>\n\n<p>Also mentioned in \"The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World\" <em>By J.
