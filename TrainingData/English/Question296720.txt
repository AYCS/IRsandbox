[{"id":296720,"title":"What does the complementizer &quot;that&quot; accomplish in terms of style?","body":"<p>I've always refrained from using words that weren't necessary to conform with grammar rules and didn't add to the meaning of a sentence.  Being a fan of brevity, I don't use the complementizer <em>that</em> unless it is necessary for the sentence to be grammatical or it clears up an ambiguity within the sentence. But I've been told the complementizer <em>that</em> serves a stylistic purpose as well. Exactly what stylistic purpose it serves has always been a mystery to me.  Whenever I ask someone, they respond with the frustrating answer \"sometimes it sounds better\". So what exactly is the stylistic end the complementizer <em>that</em> accomplishes?  </p>\n\n<p>For instance: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Raines said (that) this incident was \"uncharacteristic of most interactions\" between the U.S. and Iranian navies. CNN</p>\n  \n  <p>Col. Steve Warren said (that) 10 senior ISIS leaders operating in both Iraq and Syria, \"including several external attack planners,\" with designs on attacking western targets, had been killed in airstrikes. CNN</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the complementizer <em>that</em> were inserted into the above sentences, how would <em>that</em> affect the way the sentence is read?</p>\n\n<p>This question is related to another question I asked yesterday,\n<a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/296490/does-using-that-to-introduce-a-subordinate-clause-serve-any-other-purpose-but\">Does using &quot;that&quot; to introduce a subordinate clause serve any other purpose but to eliminate ambiguity?</a>  </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":296490,"title":"Does using &quot;that&quot; to introduce a subordinate clause serve any other purpose but to eliminate ambiguity?","body":"<p>I've always been taught to use \"that\" to introduce a subordinate clause only if there is an ambiguity in the meaning of a sentence without it. </p>\n\n<p>For instance: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He said on Monday he had lost his dog. (unclear) </p>\n  \n  <p>He said that on Monday he had lost his dog. (clear) </p>\n  \n  <p>He said on Monday that he had lost his dog.
