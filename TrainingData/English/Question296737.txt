The plates have the text \"Nevr2L8\" (Never too Late). Shortly after recieving them, I ordered new frames with the text \"Except on Mondays\". I picked up the frames today, went inside my house to fit the new plates and thought... holy mother... isn't it <strong>except for</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>So which is correct:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm never too late, except <strong>on</strong> Mondays. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm never too late, except <strong>for</strong> Mondays.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't want to drive around in a nice car looking (thinking of looking) stupid. </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":251066,"title":"Except (for) me","body":"<p>Despite several posts around preposition for <strong>except</strong>, such as <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/104632/except-for-vs-except-on\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/58657/except-for-vs-except-in\">this one</a>, I'm still not sure if I understand how to use it correctly.
