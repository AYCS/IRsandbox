It is also used when a villain is actively trying to become a hero's primary nemesis.  I've only seen it in comedic or informal settings, or when talking about a hero/villain relationship.  It probably sprang from 'arch-enemy', but I'm trying to find where and when this phrasing was first used.  Can this be sourced to a particular work?
