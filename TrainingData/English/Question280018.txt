And we also know that since the early nineteenth century there has been a steady decline in the use of \"whom\" especially in speech, and people tend to use \"who\" most of the times. Let's assume, however, that someone is writing a formal letter and that he prefers to use \"whom\" whenever possible.  He got stuck on these two sentences:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>They chose the candidate who they thought would have the best initiative.</li>\n  <li>They chose the candidate whom they thought would have the best initiative.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If \"whom\" is the right relative, he will have no problem using \"who\" because it's also acceptable.  But if the right relative is \"who\", then it would be a mistake to use whom. My question is: \"In the above sentence, is the relative pronoun the object of \"thought\" or is it the subject of \"would have\".  </p>\n\n<p>PS I'm aware that some scholars advise against asking questions about \"whom\" because \"who\" is the relative pronoun most people use.
