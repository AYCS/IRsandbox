Why is it that parallelism cannot happen between \"was\" and \"differed\" here, but has to happen between \"determined\" and \"differed\"? Are there any explicit rules in established grammar reference that forbids conjunction between active and passive voice? What about a casual sentence like \"I got up and was greeted by my dog\"?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Peter has pointed out the real issue here is that \"determined\" is used as a modifier rather than a verb here. So clearly D is ruled out since \"differ\" can only be used in an active voice sense here.</p>\n"},{"id":253987,"title":"Why does &quot;written&quot; become the past participle in this sentence?","body":"<p>Consider the following sentence: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Harry Potter is the best book ever written. \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The word \"written\" is the past participle, but why? </p>\n\n<p>I believe it's the passive voice, but I have a friend who disagrees.</p>\n\n<p>From my understanding, Harry Potter is the direct object of the verb \"write,\" but has now become the subject.</p>\n"},{"id":218228,"title":"Questions about &quot;get&quot; vs. &quot;was given&quot; and the Passive Voice","body":"<p>What is the difference in meaning between <em>got</em> and <em>was given</em>? </p>\n\n<p>I understand that <em>got</em> is in the active voice, <em>was given</em> is in the passive voice, and that they are different verbs.
