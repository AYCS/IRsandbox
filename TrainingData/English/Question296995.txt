Or if if you want them to hang out they say do I look like an ATM you are always trying to get me to spend money! Or they would answer you just don't want to spend your money on gas.

You don’t need to worry about whether your remarks benefit you, or harm you throughout the occasion. Speak up freely anything that comes to your mind” to participants. At Bureikoh gathering, everybody is considered to be totally equal, regardless company CEO and sales clerk, boss and subordinate, senior and junior, coach and player, professor and students. You are not punished by whatever you spoke out in Bureiko gathering.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of “Bureikoh” dates back to the warring Middle age (13 Century) when the monarch needed to listen to the voice of his followers on his governance, policy and deeds.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the provenance of “Bureiko” and “bù fēn zuò cì”, is there any English short word corresponding to “Bureiko,” or “Bù fēn zuò cì” in the meaning of equal opportunity of speech and opinion among all?</p>\n\n<p>In Democratic western countries where everybody is regarded to be equal, I wonder if the concept of \"Bureikoh / Bù fēn zuò cì\" is viable or not.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I thought “informal meeting” could be close to “Bureiko.” But if you call your CEO or boss a “nuts” or “F_ you” on spot even if it’s informal meeting, you’ll probably get the backlash. Whereas, “無礼講-Bureiko literally means “No punishment on rudeness,” thus nobody will be punished (theoretically) by throwing abuse to, or criticizing superior in expressing his / her own personal opinion, <strong>once Bureiko is declared upfront</strong> of the gathering, because it’s the rule of Bureiko.</p>\n"},{"id":138549,"title":"Term for talking about a subject or idea you did not want to talk about?","body":"<p>Specifically, is there a term for the situation where both parties agree not to discuss a certain subject and in so doing end up engaging in a discussion about the very topic they said they wouldn't?</p>\n\n<p>An example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Person A: \"What do you want to talk about?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Person B: \"Anything but the weather.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Person A: \"Agreed, I find it boring to discuss the weather.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Person B: \"Me too.

The feeling I'm trying to invoke is the kind you feel when a student claims to understand philosophy, then calls David Hume \"light reading\" or \"pop philosophy,\" despite demonstrating clear unfamiliarity with the subject.
