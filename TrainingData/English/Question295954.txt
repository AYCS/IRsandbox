I'm not sure if we can apply these terms to someone who knows multiple programming languages.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, <em>polyglot</em> is used in programming jargon too but it means a program/script written in multiple programming languages.</p>\n\n<p>I found an article that discusses the real value of learning more than one programming language and there are the terms <strong><em>multilingual coder</em></strong> and <strong><em>versatile programmer</em></strong> used. These terms are self-explanatory but are they well-established? Also, I wonder if there is any single word used in tech jargon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Well, you probably know that learning multiple languages is part of the traditional university track—programmers with degrees in computer science will usually have trained in half a dozen languages by graduation. But what's the value of being a multilingual coder in the workplace, where your projects are less theoretical?</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Not only are languages different tools for different jobs, but they are technologies that shape how you think about programming,\" says Richard Pattis, a senior lecturer of Informatics at UC Irvine who invented the Karel educational programming language in 1981. But this isn't an outright endorsement of learning two-plus languages—it matters which ones you pick. \"Learning similar languages might not progress your thinking much,\" says Pattis.</p>\n  \n  <p>To expand their minds, Pattis recommends that versatile programmers learn languages from different language paradigms, whether it be object-oriented languages (e.g., C++/Java), functional languages (e.g., ML and Haskell), scripting languages (e.g., Lisp and Python), logic-based languages (e.g., Prolog), or low-level languages (like C, the Java Virtual Machine or a machine language).</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.fastcolabs.com/3029274/whats-the-real-value-of-learning-more-than-one-programming-language\" rel=\"nofollow\">fastcolabs.com / article by David Lumb</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":234975,"title":"Is there a word or phrase for helping someone when you are better equipped than them?","body":"<p>Is there a word or phrase for doing a favour or helping someone because you are in a better position than they are to get it done?</p>\n\n<p>For example, it would take me a lot longer to herd some cattle than it would for a cowboy to, so this word/phrase would apply if I asked the cowboy to help me (but not if I asked someone equally or less capable than myself).
