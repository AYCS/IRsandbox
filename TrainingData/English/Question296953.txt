I would think so as it describes a relationship, but one could say \"the opposites heat and cold\", in which case as a pair they are opposites, so would that just make them both 'an opposite', as used in the first definition?</p>\n"},{"id":261479,"title":"Opposite of &quot;excess&quot; in this context","body":"<p>What would be the appropriate word opposite to \"excess\" in the following sentence?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The excess number of particles in the box is negative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I want to write about a depletion of particles rather than an excess.

From my perspective, \"relational\" refers to \"relationships\" (between different objects), and anything that is non-relational should refer to things that are internal to any given object, and independent of any relationship to other objects.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of a good word that stands in contrast to \"relational\"?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>It looks like I need to be more specific. Let's say I have a set of objects. Given any two objects, I can describe their relationship (e.g., \"the axis of A is 10deg below the axis of B\") in  way that cannot be done when I consider a single object. I would call such properties \"relational\". Given a single object, it has properties that are completely independent of the other objects in the set (e.g., \"object A is red\"). I am looking for a word to describe such properties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is another way to think about the question, that pushes the problem elsewhere. \"Atomic\" properties are properties of the individual objects (in the literal sense of \"atom\" as originally introduced: \"indivisible\"). \"Hollistic\" properties are properties of the entire set. What do we call properties of pairs of objects? </p>\n"},{"id":175750,"title":"Opposite of Dying","body":"<p>What single word means the opposite of dying, in other words, the \"verb of becoming alive/living from the subject\".</p>\n\n<p>Context: Today while writing code I commented that one part of it was the \"Dying\" code for an object, but then I tried to comment the other part of it, the code that runs when the object is being created.
