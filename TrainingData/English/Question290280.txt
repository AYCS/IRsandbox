I don't think it is needed there because the last element of the parallel structure is 'influencing the lifespan of discourse referents,' or so I think.

But is that an entirely separate aspect of meaning, or is\n  it dependent upon other aspects of meaning, such as the referential\n  and truth-conditional aspect? --- (page 225 of <a href=\"http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/courses/hyper/heim1983.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">'File Change Semantics\n  and the Familiarity Theory of Definiteness'</a> by Irene Heim)</p>\n</blockquote>\n","related_questions":[{"id":103919,"title":"Is the comma before &quot;with&quot; necessary?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>The Oscars may not take place until February 24, but awards season is already in full swing, with the Golden Globes among Hollywood's many red-carpet events.
