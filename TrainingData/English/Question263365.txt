Patrons ride in a log boat that travels along a water flume, and the ride culminates in a final, steep drop. A common feature is that just before the drop, a hidden camera takes a photo of the riders, who are usually in a state of shock. The photos are then shown for all to see after the ride, where one may purchase those photos.</p>\n\n<p>This has spawned a practice where some patrons will deliberately make an inappropriate face or pose for this camera, which sometimes produces hilarious results.</p>\n"},{"id":250531,"title":"Word or small phrase for an object owned by a customer on which you will do work","body":"<p>The word or small phrase needs to fit into both of these sentences:</p>\n\n<p>I've created a new job to install our product into this _______.<br/>\nThis ______ is owned by Joe Bloggs. </p>\n\n<p>I'm creating an IT system for a company that installs products into customer's vehicles, boats, ride-on lawnmowers, garage doors and potentially houses.
