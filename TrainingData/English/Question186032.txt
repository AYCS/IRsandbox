Along with some rules on how to use <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ly\"><em>-ly</em></a> which do not mention that the use of a word such as <em>parallelly</em> may be incorrect. I don't know how Wiktionary is fact checked, so I have come here instead asking the question to professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Being a non-native speaker and having no background in human language apart from high school (computer languages all the way) this question and the following debate interests me greatly. The answer I am looking for probably makes a distinction between variants of English.
