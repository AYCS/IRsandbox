I see this word used a lot on the internet to describe (usually in TV shows) when something that one character did in a past episode is similar to something that a character (usually different, but I've also seen it used to point out character development via slight differences in the parallel). </p>\n\n<p>It kind of describes two completely separate scenes that have a much more powerful meaning when juxtaposed (usually very blatant mirroring, etc. to point this out to viewer/reader). In my case, it would be the scene with Aschenbach observing the man on the boat and the scene where Aschenbach applies makeup for Tadzio.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the man on the boat foreshadows the \"endgame\" for Aschenbach. In my essay, I've referred to it mostly as foreshadowing, but I think the depth of the connection that Mann makes warrants something a little stronger. The word foil came to mind, in terms of the intensity and how it's character specific, but obviously, it has the opposite meaning of what I'm going for.</p>\n\n<p>I did think about just using the word \"parallel\", but I when I looked it up, the definition for the word parallelism came up, and as a literary term it seemed from <a href=\"http://literarydevices.net/parallelism/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this definition</a>, it seems that this word as a literary device refers to parallel syntax and a not to a broader similarity. </p>\n\n<p>I've come up with \"symmetry\" and \"mirror\" to describe individual aspects, but I was wondering if there is a proper term that encompasses the broad connection between the two characters.</p>\n"},{"id":227199,"title":"How to name non-web software?","body":"<p>I am writing an article that is focus on websites and web applications.

The debate becomes about the ethnic mix of their social circle or supporters, both of which are irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>This rhetoric is characterised by the location of people's country of origin rather than their race.</p>\n\n<p>An example statement would be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I'm not racist, but only British people should be able to apply for British jobs.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"26 million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are they after?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't think these statements are <em>racist</em> exactly, as a person could be any race and be British, or not be British and still be of an Anglo-Saxon white origin. </p>\n\n<p>However they do represent a kind of discrimination: they state that if the most skilled person for a job is not from the UK they should be rejected in favour of a less skilled local. They state that someone who isn't British should not get the same rights and privileges as someone who is. </p>\n\n<p>The rhetoric that goes with these statements tends to also make value statements about the immigrants in question, often describing their intentions as parasitic or that these immigrants would be seeking to change British culture or legislation.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a term for that kind of discrimination or prejudice?</p>\n\n<p>Please note that I'm not trying to encourage any kind of political debate on here - I'm just looking for a way to describe this kind of political argument as discriminatory without referring to race.</p>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<p>This question has been flagged incorrectly as a duplicate. I know that the legal definition of <em>racism</em> includes discrimination based on nationality. However, in the UK political sphere at least, the common interpretation of of racism is limited to racial groups. The political parties that use this rhetoric do not consider it to be racist, and the pejorative nature of the term means that using it just ends any chance of building an argument that they might actually listen to.  </p>\n\n<p>I understand that <em>racist</em> is technically correct, I'm asking for constructive alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>The answers to that question do not help with this issue.</p>\n\n<h2>Update 2</h2>\n\n<p><em>Xenophobic</em> is a good answer, but not really what I'm looking for as it implies the motivation for the behaviour, rather than describing the behaviour itself.</p>\n\n<p>For instance a typical response might be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I've got nothing against foreigners, I just think Britain is full - there's no more room.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This moves the argument to a different point (whether they hate or fear foreigners) and I don't want to do that. I want to describe the discrimination against foreigners without making my own judgements about their motivation for doing so.</p>\n\n<h2>Update 3</h2>\n\n<p>This question has been flagged as a duplicate of another question, but these are different questions with different answers. The supposed duplicate asks: <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159908\">If a person holds prejudice against people because of their nationality, would that be considered racist?</a> - I'm specifically not asking about prejudice; I'm asking about <em>discrimination</em>. </p>\n\n<p>I can state that a political party's policies or proposals are inherently discriminatory if the action treats one group differently from another. I'm not making a judgement about them if I do so, I'm just stating a deduction.</p>\n\n<p>I can't state for certain that this discrimination is due to their prejudice - they may or may not have prejudiced opinions, but accusing them of prejudice causes offence and any constructive discussion ends there.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there a way to describe behaviour that discriminates without making guesses as to the motivation or any prejudice behind it?</p>\n"},{"id":141519,"title":"How are invented names like “scrypt” pronounced that include nonstandard abbreviations?","body":"<p>In technical contexts, I often come across terms that are invented names where some underlying meaning is not spelled out but can be inferred. This inferred meaning would often be lost if one tried to pronounce the term purely based on the letters comprising it. It seems to me that one cannot get such issues right, because any choice probably looks objectionable either to a very literal or a very technical person. What is the proper pronunciation for such terms?</p>\n\n<p>A good example for the kind of terms I am thinking of is <em>scrypt</em>, a computer algorithm for computing cryptographic hashes that enjoys tremendous popularity among geeks. In case the inventor's intention matters, his company's <a href=\"https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">webpage about <em>scrypt</em></a> seems to be the best source of information available but still does not address this issue. Neither does the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article about <em>scrypt</em></a>. What I think I can infer only serves to complicate the decision: There are other, older algorithms for essentially the same purpose that follow the naming convention of having a single letter followed by <em>crypt</em>, of which <em>bcrypt</em> is widely known but not the only example. There are good reasons to suspect that the initial letter in <em>scrypt</em> might be intended as an abbreviation rather than just a random distinction. The rest of the name almost certainly has its roots in computer history. See the Wikipedia articles for two meanings of <em>crypt</em>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_%28C%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">computer library function <em>crypt</em>(3)</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_%28Unix%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">utility program <em>crypt</em>(1)</a>. Both are closely related to <em>scrypt</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I've only started thinking about this question due to an identical <a href=\"http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18353/how-is-scrypt-pronounced\">question</a> (put on hold for being off-topic) on the Bitcoin branch of StackExchange. The two submitted answers, including my own attempt at explaining my personal preference, indicate that there is no consensus. Since there the topic is almost tangential anyways (<em>scrypt</em> is used in some alternatives to Bitcoin but not in Bitcoin itself), I have tried asking the same <a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/46692/how-is-scrypt-pronounced\">question</a> on the Information Security branch of StackExchange, where one commentator gave what he claimed to be a definite, if unexplained, answer yet simultaneously declared the question off-topic.</p>\n\n<p>Is this the right place? And how does one decide such questions for which I would, naïvely, have assumed that technical background knowledge is required to decide if something is special enough to be granted exceptional status regarding its pronunciation?</p>\n\n<p>On the same subject, what makes not capitalizing the proper noun <em>scrypt</em> or <em>crypt</em> acceptable? There seems to be widespread consensus amongst computer enthusiasts to never capitalize at the very least certain commands, specifically those that in their usual application as computer commands are case sensitive, meaning that they do not work as intended when typed in capital letters. Whilst to somebody using such commands it indeed seems very natural to follow this convention, seeing it done at the beginning of a sentence, as in the first sentence of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_%28C%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia link already given above</a>, does not feel quite right, either. Is the usage as in that Wikipedia article, employing a different capitalization for the same initial word in the title and the first paragraph, in any way proper?</p>\n"},{"id":123048,"title":"How to Reference a Figure Based on a Corresponding Table?","body":"<p>I am currently writing a thesis.
