Let's call this <em>who/who/whom</em> usage, matching nominative, accusative, and dative respectively.  This appears to be moderately widespread, the death of <em>whom</em> notwithstanding.  For an accusative example, consider <em>Is there anyone who I could ask?</em> vs. <em>Is there anyone whom I could ask?</em></p>\n\n<p>Are there authorities who explicitly recognise the possibility of differentiating between the accusative and dative constructions in this way?  To document what I have looked at so far:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>APA 6th</em> stands by the old-fashioned <em>who/whom/whom</em>, saying \"Use <em>who</em> as the subject of a verb and <em>whom</em> as the object of a verb or preposition\" (3.20).  <em>Chicago 6th</em> has a very similar formulation (5.63).  <em>The Economist style guide</em> has a nice discussion explaining its identical prescription.</li>\n<li><em>Butcher's</em> and <em>New Hart's Rules</em> both say that grammar should be correct, but say little about what correct grammar consists of.  I think <em>MLA</em> also doesn't prescribe on this point.</li>\n<li><em>Fowler's 3rd</em> articulates three rival views, namely that (i) <em>who/whom/whom</em> is moribund, stifling, or artifical, and <em>who/who/who</em> is the right usage, (ii) the righteous <em>who/whom/whom</em> should be defended against the slacker <em>who/who/who</em>, and (iii) <em>who/whom/whom</em> is appropriate for written language, but <em>who/who/who</em> for spoken language (from CGEL).  Fowler's further talks about tricky issues about the use of <em>who/whom</em> as a relative pronoun vs. as an interrogative pronoun.   <em>Fowler's</em> makes no prescription about this.  <em>Who/who/whom</em> is defensible according to Fowler's reasoning, but the possibility of this usage is not discussed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Bonus points to anyone finding relevant guidance from CGEL.</p>\n"},{"id":57458,"title":"“By whom?” vs. “Who by?”","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/56/whats-the-rule-for-using-who-or-whom\">What&#39;s the rule for using &ldquo;who&rdquo; or &ldquo;whom&rdquo;?</a><br>\n  <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/7932/with-who-vs-with-whom\">With who vs. With whom</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Are “by whom?” and “who by?” perfect equivalents?</p>\n\n<p>I have the feeling that the use of “who by?” is just a way of avoiding use “whom” but I have no evidence or proof.
