Other sources have elaborated that the older Germanic root had a meaning of a thicket or wild, unruly, heath where one might get tangled among the <em>hell</em> of thistles.</p>\n\n<p>I've often wondered, considering the influence of Norse language on English during the Viking settlements, or invasions, if there is any etymological link to the figure Hel (or Hella, or Hela). She was one of the three \"strange children\" of Loki and the Giantess Angurboda; the other two were Fenris and Jormungand. She also ruled the eponymous realm, Helheim (Hel-Home).</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the possible English/Norse relation, there is, of course, a possible Judeo-Christian relation, with \"Hell\" and \"Sheol,\" as Hella's realm was an underworld where those who were -not- slain in battle went after death. Of course, all of these elements may very well have been mixed up and juggled about during the centuries.</p>\n\n<p>For all I know, the etymology could have influenced in the other direction, ie., from Old English to Norse. This is why I'm asking!
