I have a generic piece of code, that I use on anything that could increase/decrease called <code>EffectCauser</code> - It has a bunch of parameters for it to work: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The target component (health, mana, speed, stamina, etc)</li>\n<li>The effect methodology (<code>OneHit</code>, <code>Overtime</code>, <code>Permanent</code>, etc)</li>\n<li>The effect type (<code>Positive</code>/<code>Negative</code>) </li>\n<li>The effect amount.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>First let me explain how this works in a couple of simple examples so that you understand better:</p>\n\n<p>Let's say I wanted to create a first aid kit. I create an <code>EffectCauser</code> which will cause its effect on the <code>Health</code> component of the target object, I specify the methodology of the effect of type <code>OneHit</code> and the type of the effect to be <code>Positive</code> and an amount I choose, lets say 100 for a full heal.</p>\n\n<p>Another example, if I wanted to create a Mana spell that decreases mana overtime:\nI would create an effect causer that targets the <code>Mana</code> component of a target, select a methodology of <code>Overtime</code> (temporarily in other words) (filling the appropriate time values), an effect type of <code>Negative</code> this time, and an amount, like 50. (Imagine a spell in an RPG game where an enemy cast it at you, so you get -50 mana over a 10 sec time period)</p>\n\n<p>And so on and so forth. I could do this for a <code>Speed</code> component, <code>Agility</code>, <code>Stamina</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The main thing for this to work is that all these things (Health, Mana, Speed, Stamina, etc) have to implement a common interface. I'm not being able to find the name of that interface.</p>\n\n<p>One common thing between all these things, is that they increase and decrease. I thought of <code>IChangable</code> but that's very generic, maybe <code>IIncreasableDecreasable</code> but that's very long, and screaming \"there's a better word than me\"</p>\n\n<p>Note that the convention of naming interfaces, is \"IXXXable\" (IMovable, ICombinable, ITransformable, etc)</p>\n\n<p>So, what can I use here? what is the word that satisfies my needs?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>\nTo make it easy, it need not be an interface. I could create an abstract class. Interfaces define behavior, while a class is for something that exists. I just have to change my way of thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Ex: an abstract <code>Character</code>, with <code>Player</code> and <code>Enemy</code> as children. <code>Player</code> and <code>Enemy</code> <em>are a</em> <code>Character</code>. (<code>Character</code> is an abstract term for <code>Enemy</code> and <code>Player</code>)</p>\n\n<p>So... what <em>are</em> <code>Health</code>, <code>Mana</code>, <code>Speed</code>, etc? For one thing, they're <code>Components</code> but what else? (I can't use <code>Component</code> here due to ambiguity as well). What about <code>PlayerAttribute</code>? well, for one thing I can attach <code>Health</code> to an enemy, not just the player. So... <code>CharacterAttribute</code> is good? nop, still ambiguous. (Attribute means a total separate thing in .NET)... I'm out of words :(</p>\n\n<p>If you ever played an RPG game, what would a common name be to all your player stuff?
