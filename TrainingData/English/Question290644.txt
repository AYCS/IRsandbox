However, I can't decide what it exaclty means in the following quote which is from god is not Great by Christopher Hitchens and where he discusses the child abuse among clergymen: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sometimes the resulting frustration expressed itself in horrible excesses of corporal punishment, which is bad enough in itself. But when the artificial inhibitions really collapse, as we have seen them do, they result in behavior which no average masturbating, fornicating sinner could even begin to contemplate without horror. This is not the result of a few <strong><em>delinquents</em></strong> among the shepherds, but an outcome of an ideology which sought to establish clerical control by means of control of the sexual instinct and even of the sexual organs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know \"delinquent\" doesn't have hundreds of meanings but I know it is used for \"an (especially young/teenager) offender of a minor crime\" and \"failure to perform one's duty\". Since I think there are no teenage clergymen to guard the children, I am confused about what the word \"deliquent\" really means here.
