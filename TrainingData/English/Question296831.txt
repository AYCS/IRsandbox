Some background about me.  I am British born and have been living abroad for many years teaching English as a Second Language at a large high school.  One of the English teachers in our team (who speaks American English) thought that the use of the word \"neglect\" as a verb usually only relates to authorities such as the local council or the government who \"neglects\" the town.  Myself and another teacher felt that the use of the word in the sentence 'The inhabitants neglected their town' was grammatically correct and acceptable.  Our colleague did some research and couldn't find any example that talks about inhabitants/residents neglecting their town. She said that it seems that is is always in the hands of authorities to take care of a town and only they can neglect it. However, people can neglect their house, front yard or any other property they own. So we started discussing the issue and I found this site and posted my question this morning.  Can you shed any more light on the issue?\nThank you so much.\nRos</p>\n"},{"id":129445,"title":"Looking for two terms from law vocabulary","body":"<p>I'm looking for two technical words used in law:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Someone who accepts the law, they will try to do the best things in any situation.</li>\n<li>The opposite of number one, they reject any law and at every chance will run away from it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>for example in the law vocab, \"ALIBI\" means : A defence where an accused alleges that at the time when the offence was committed, he was elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for words like that! like \"objection\" or ...</p>\n"},{"id":19334,"title":"What is it called when the word &quot;sorry&quot; is not used for apologizing?","body":"<p>When I use the word \"sorry\" for something I did wrong</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm sorry I bumped into you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would be apologizing.
