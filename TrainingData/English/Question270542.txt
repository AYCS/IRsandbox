Amassing critical and previously overlooked evidence from Dolní Ve vstonice and the neighboring site of Pavlov, Olga Soffer, James Adovasio, and David Hyland now propose that human survival there had little to do with manly men hurling spears at big-game animals. Instead, observes Soffer, one of the world’s leading authorities on Ice Age hunters and gatherers and an archeologist at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, it depended largely on women, plants, and a technique of hunting previously invisible in the archeological evidence—net hunting. <strong><em>This is not the image we’ve always had of Upper Paleolithic macho guys out killing animals up close and personal</em></strong>, Soffer explains. Net hunting is communal, and it involves the labor of children and women. And this has lots of implications. </p>\n"},{"id":261780,"title":"Can you &quot;Build a coffee&quot;?","body":"<p>Would it be valid or invalid English, to use phrases along the following lines:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can you build a coffee?</li>\n<li>I'm building a coffee</li>\n<li>I'm going to go and build a coffee</li>\n<li>I built a coffee</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Etc.</p>\n"},{"id":229692,"title":"Could you pass me the salt? or Could you pass the salt?","body":"<p>Which of the following more common?\n1) Could you pass me the salt?\n2) Could you pass the salt?
