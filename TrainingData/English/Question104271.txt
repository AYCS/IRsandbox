I have seen this translated to alimony, and maintenance in English. However, as the following entries from OALD (8th Ed.) for <em>alimony</em> and <em>maintenance</em> state, alimony and maintenance refer to the <strong>money paid by the husband after divorce</strong>   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>main • ten • ance      BrE   / meɪntənəns /  NAmE   / meɪntənəns /<br>\n  noun </p>\n  \n  <p> word origin   example bank    [ uncountable ]    1   ~ (of sth)   the\n  act of keeping sth in good condition by checking or repairing it\n  regularly  The school pays for heating and the maintenance of the\n  buildings.    car maintenance    2   ~ (of sth)   the act of making a\n  state or situation continue  the maintenance of international peace<br>\n  3   ( law ) ( BrE )  money that sb must pay regularly to their former\n  wife, husband or partner, especially when they have had children\n  together  He has to pay maintenance to his ex-wife.    child\n  maintenance    a maintenance order  (= given by a court of law)<br>\n  see also  alimony</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Under <em>alimony</em>, it says,   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ali • mony  BrE   / ælɪməni /  NAmE   / ælɪmoʊni /    noun </p>\n  \n  <p> word origin   example bank    [ uncountable ]  ( especially NAmE ) \n  the money that a court orders sb to pay regularly to their former wife\n  or husband when the marriage is ended     compare  maintenance , \n  palimony</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above and <a href=\"http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5692?txt_QuestionID\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> suggest that Islamic Law has no financial obligation on the man after divorce in terms of financial support for the woman.<br>\nAll in all, is it still acceptable to use alimony in this context i.e. when provisions are given only during marriage as opposed to the given definition of regular post-marriage payment?
