Apparently, the reason why I pronounce the words \"seen\" and \"sing\" the exact same way (as well as \"long\" and \"lawn\", \"dean\" and \"ding,\" etc.) is because I have difficulty pronouncing the ŋ at the end of words that finish off with a g. Is it common for native English speakers - I'm from Michigan, by the way - to have this sort of dialect? And why is it that someone would have difficulty saying this sound?
