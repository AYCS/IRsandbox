[{"id":275734,"title":"A word for a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive)","body":"<p>I'm a programmer. I'm so sick of writing documentation for things that should be explainable in a word. </p>\n\n<p>When you write a function in a programming language, you get to name its parameters. Most things I can name easy enough, such as \"Name\" or \"URL\" or \"MaxSizeN\". The first 2 are self explanatory, the last one is the maximum size of something in relevant data units(as opposed to bytes or some other unit) but that one is easily understood by other programmers too. </p>\n\n<p>Very often though, there is a parameter that is a floating point type (float) that needs an input in the range of 0 to 1 (inclusive). This is problematic since I have no idea what to call those things so I have to write function descriptors (assuming the language has them) or document it some other way which is annoying.</p>\n\n<p>Lets say this float needs to define the accuracy of something so I declare it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function FuncName(float Accuracy)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is very ambiguous since the type float itself can contain a ridiculously large variety of numbers. Meanwhile if I were to declare it as such:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function FuncName(float AccuracyPercent)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then its immediately obvious that the input should be a value from 0 to 100. </p>\n\n<p>Percentages aren't useful for math however, they are more like a \"human friendly\" markup for fractions and have no place in actual program logic and I'd rather avoid unnecessary overhead. </p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for a word that I could mangle into my parameter names so that they would convey \"this should be from 0 to 1\". </p>\n\n<p>I don't even care if the word is unknown to most people, I'll just start using it and tell others to read the dictionary :D </p>\n\n<p>Is there any word for that?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":282464,"title":"Word for &quot;add value to&quot;","body":"<p>If I want to describe two financial investments that are mutually beneficial, that is, the first investment increases the value of the second, while the second increases the value of the first, what single word can I use in the phrase \"reciprocating ______\". </p>\n\n<p>It would be the opposite of devaluation, I guess, but somehow no one ever got around to making \"envaluation\" a word. \"Mutally beneficial\" doesn't work because it's not specifically pecuniary. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: It's to be used in a heading, so I'm hoping for an \"action thing\", or, as I just learned, a deverbal noun [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deverbal_noun\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>].
