It effectively means (in Britain at least) they cannot sit in the Chamber for 5 consecutive days and lose a corresponding amount of salary.</p>\n\n<p>But to be <strong><em>suspended from the service of the House</em></strong> does not seem correct English. Does it mean the Member's service of the House? Or does it mean the House's service of the Member? If the former it would seem to me that <strong><em>of</em></strong> should be replaced with <strong><em>to</em></strong>, and the definite article removed - so that it becomes <strong><em>suspended from service to the House</em></strong>. If it is the latter it doesn't seem to make sense.
