In fact, virtually all results I could find seem to talk about people who - literally - play a musical instrument, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet\" rel=\"nofollow\">trumpet</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I can see some possible explanations that could (remotely) make some sense also in the context of the question, although they realistically strike me as quite far-fetched:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It might be a general way to express \"make noise\" (literally and figuratively), by talking, singing, jumping around, or whatever other freedom is desired that would not be possible in the described context (of a university lecture hall).</li>\n<li>Trumpets can be used to play recognizeable melodies, and thus may serve as leading or solo instruments. Hence, \"playing the trumpet\" could be a euphemism for \"taking the lead\", for instance, in a group working on a project, as opposed to a lecture hall, where the lecturer has the superior role towards all attendees.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given that a euphemism is used in the first place, though, it could also be that the expression is meant to refer to a taboo-ish topic:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If we concentrate on the <em>play</em> part (with the <em>trumpet</em> being a somewhat arbitrary placeholder for the object of playing to create a memorable expression), the expression might be interpreted as a euphemism for \"masturbation\".</li>\n<li>If we concentrate on the <em>trumpet</em> part, i.e. something that creates loud sounds, the expression might refer to \"(audible) flatulence\".</li>\n<li>In fact, the direct Chinese translation of \"playing the trumpet\" (\"吹喇叭\") seems to be used in Taiwan as a euphemism for fellatio.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With the background in mind that this is about something that could cause students to urgently leave a lecture rather than wait for some one or two hours until it ends, not a single one of these interpretations sounds actually likely (even less so if the activity would require several students to suddenly feel the same need).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, my question is: <strong>What does the expression \"play the trumpet\" mean (if it means anything), and if so, is it commonly used in English (or just in some English-speaking places)?</strong></p>\n"},{"id":230978,"title":"Word for development or improvement in art","body":"<p>In human race you call evolution to upgrade mankind, in technology innovation , how about the art work? how u call it? from painting to graphic design</p>\n"},{"id":149791,"title":"what&#39;s the meaning of &quot;country- years&quot;","body":"<p>What's the meaning of \"country- years\"?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Democratic legislatures approved only 76 percent of bills proposed by the executive branch during 783 country- years </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/K0O8yn\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>Democracy and the Limits of Self-Government\n By Adam Przeworski</sup></a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EezWJ.png\" alt=\"&quot;Suppose that the government perseveres with a policy that is unpopular. If this policy is subject to legislative approval, the government may fail in the parliament. Opposition parties may persuade government supporters to modify their views, they can exercise their institutional prerogatives to block some legislation (in Germany, presidencies of parliamentary committees are distributed proportionately to party strength; in the United Kingdom the Committe of Public Accounts is always controlled by the opposition); they can threaten with obstructive tactics (a government proposal to privatize an electric utility company was met with thousands of amendments in France; filibuster in the U.S. Senate); and they can threaten with noncooperation at lower levels of governments they control. Governments do not always get what they want in the legislatures: According to Saiegh (2009), democractic legislatures approved only 76 percent of bills proposed by the executive branch during 783 country-years for which these data are available.&quot; &quot;But can people outside the parliament effectively influence government decisions? Manin (1997: 170), for one, makes this argument:&quot; &quot;Freedom of public opinion is a democratic feature of representative systems, in that it provides a means whereby the voice of the people can reach those who govern.... Representatives are not required to act on the wishes of the people, but neither can they ignore them: freedom of public opinion ensures that such wishes can be expressed and be brought to the attention of those who govern. It is the representatives who make the final decision, but a framework is created in which the will of the people is one of the considerations in their decision process.&quot;\"></p>\n"},{"id":71073,"title":"Less vulgar synonyms for &quot;circlejerk&quot;","body":"<p>Someone asked in the Math.StackExchange chatroom what a \"more refined word for circlejerk\" might be.
