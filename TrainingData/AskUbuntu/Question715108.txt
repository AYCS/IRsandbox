But checking an changing the owners' rights of files known to cause such problems. Unfortunately this didn't solve the problem.\nAfter some webresearch I found out that nvidia driver updates recently caused similiar problems, so i removed and purged the driver files. I expected that there would be a image on the display though, like in VGA-mode in Windows OS.\nThis is not the case, so now I'm facing a blackscreen problem in addition, that somehow cant be fixed by reinstalling the drivers, or never was caused by purging the nvidia-drivers.</p>\n\n<p>What I did before the xinit Problem in the first place appeared:\n - I added this script to the autostart:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n#!/bin/sh\n# wait for the dock state to change\nsleep 2.0\nDOCKED=$(cat /sys/devices/platform/dock.0/docked)\ncase \"$DOCKED\" in\n    \"0\")\n       #undocked event - lets remove all connected outputs apart from LVDS\n       for output in $(/usr/bin/xrandr -d :0.0 --verbose|grep \" connected\"|grep -v LVDS|awk '{print $1}')\n         do\n         /usr/bin/xrandr -d :0.0 --output $output --off\n       done\n    xrandr --output LVDS1 --rotation normal\n        xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen stylus\" MapToOutput LVDS1\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen eraser\" MapToOutput LVDS1\n    # rotates the tablet input to the according position (half=180°, (c)cw=(counter)clockwise, none=normal)\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen stylus\" rotate none\n    # if multiouch present set: xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch\" rotate half\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen eraser\" rotate none\n    ;;\n    \"1\")\n    ## rotates internal Laptop Display LVDS1 to inverted\n    xrandr --output HDMI2 --auto --above LVDS1\n    xrandr --output LVDS1 --rotation inverted\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen stylus\" MapToOutput LVDS1\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen eraser\" MapToOutput LVDS1\n    # rotates the tablet input to the according position (half=180°, (c)cw=(counter)clockwise, none=normal)\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen stylus\" rotate half\n    # if multiouch present set: xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 E6 Finger touch\" rotate half\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom ISDv4 90 Pen eraser\" rotate half\n    ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>some standard updates from Canonical were installed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>I use:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Kubuntu 12.10</p></li>\n<li><p>Lenovo x230t</p></li>\n<li><p>intel core i7 3520M with integrated HD 4000 graphics</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Additional information about the initial errors, before purging nvidia:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/29/startxverbose.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of startx -v</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/199/konsolenzeilennachlogin.JPG/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Console lines after attempt to login via lightdm</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/32/lsla1.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of ls -la 1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/844/lsla2.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of ls -la 2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/705/lsla3.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of ls -la 3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/534/lsla4.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of ls -la 4</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/826/lsla5.jpg/\" rel=\"nofollow\">output of ls -la 5</a></p>\n"},{"id":238059,"title":"How to build plasma netbook?","body":"<p>i got source code of kde-workspace from repository as below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get build-dep kde-workspace\napt-get source kde-workspace\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then, i switched to plasma netbook shell source directory, and run cmake:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cd kde-workspace/plasma/netbook/shell\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ../\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And after this, i get error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CMake Error at nettoolbox/CMakeLists.txt:7 (kde4_add_plugin):\n   Unknown CMake command \"kde4_add_plugin\".</p>\n  \n  <p>-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's possible to build plasma netbook separately from kde-workspace?</p>\n"},{"id":117904,"title":"How To Install KDE Plasma Desktop On Ubuntu?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/417/how-do-i-install-kde-shell-on-ubuntu\">How do I install KDE shell on Ubuntu?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey guys I am new to Ubuntu, I have installed Ubuntu 11.10, with Gnome, and i am not so happy with unity, I want to install KDE plasma, can I install KDE plasma on Ubuntu, or I have to download entire OS again to have KDS Plasma Desktop.</p>\n"}]}]
