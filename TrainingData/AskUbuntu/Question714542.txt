This occurs with multiple pairs of headphones and does not occur when I boot into Windows 10.</p>\n\n<p>My uneducated guess is that it has something to do with the headphone jack also being available as a mic jack, as plugging in headphones seems to occasionally cause the system to recognize a non-existent mic and deactivate the internal mic.</p>\n\n<p>So far, I've tried:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>disabling auto-mute and killing the mic/mic boost from <code>alsamixer</code></li>\n<li>disabling <code>INTEL_AUDIO_POWERSAVE</code> in <code>/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/intel-audio-powersave</code> (had to do this any way to stop headphone buzz while idling)</li>\n<li>overriding the mic connection pin to \"not connected\" with <code>hdajackretask</code></li>\n<li>overriding the headphone connection pin to \"headphone\" with <code>hdajackretask</code></li>\n<li>muting the monitors of built-in audio with <code>pavucontrol</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So far, none of these have made any difference.

I checked under sounds settings in the main settings and the only output available is \"Headphones - built-in-audio\". Even when my headphones aren't plugged in it says the same thing. I opened up pavucontorl and also checked there. It said my in-built-speakers were unavailalbe but when I played sound it played through them. Please help me, I've been lingering for so long. Ubuntu 14.04. I just installed it the other day and the speakers don't work ever since. FYI, my speakers work via alsamixer when no headpones are plugged in but once headphones are connected, sound plays through the speaker and the headphones.
