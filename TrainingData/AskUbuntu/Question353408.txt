(What I mean is that the version loaded on the device was altered from a traditional installation: Chrome was installed by default, I was prompted to create backup media powered by Dell, etc.) This has thus far proven to be impossible on both 14.04 and 15.04, and I am hoping that someone knows how to proceed.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's what I know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The device DOES allow me to boot to a USB drive created by UNetbootin running either 14.04 or 15.04.</li>\n<li>I AM able to complete the installation process and reboot.</li>\n<li>Upon rebooting, the device DOES NOT boot successfully.

The upgrade was successful, but once I rebooted I wasn't able to log into Ubuntu (probably due to a change in the boot loader from Legacy to UEFI, which I am certain grub was supposed to handle, but whatever!). One thing led to another and a re-installation attempt led to me having a single OS on my laptop(Tahr) and me losing all data. I removed Tahr, re-installed Windows 7 Home Premium and created the partitions.
