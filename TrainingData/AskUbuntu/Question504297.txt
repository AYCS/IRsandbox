When I go to the official TeamSpeak Download Site <a href=\"http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> I have several options to download for Linux. I downloaded the AMD64 client package (using fully updated 64bit Ubuntu). I went and checked the \"Start as Program\" checkbox in the properties of the .run file. Sadly when I started it with a doubleclick gedit opened it (and crashed after a while).\nSo I navigated to the folder and did: ./TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.0.15.1.run\nIt worked and I had a folder with Teamspeak in my Downloads folder.\nBut although I checked the \"Start as Program\" checkbox for the ts3client_linux_amd64 it does nothing.. If I rightclick and choose \"Run as application\" nothing happens (at least I see nothing).\nThe ts3client_runscript.sh opens in gedit beneath enabling the said checkbox.</p>\n\n<p>Any way to get it working?

Or, what&#39;s xcb and qt and how do they solve the riddles of my life?","body":"<p>tl;dr is at the bottom for those not wanting reasons, just questions.</p>\n\n<p>I have the latest TeamSpeak client downloaded from the site of the authors of said program. I've managed, after a load of fiddling then some searching, that a .run file is stupidly packaged and needs modifying to be an executable instead, so I did that and ran the bleeding thing. It gave me a folder full of useless twiddle and files that were named as if they were thought up by a hyper-active, Star Trek addicted seven year old doped up on a recent 10 season marathon and various amphetamines. </p>\n\n<p>I got a bit frustrated at the lack of working files and then went online where I noticed people were just telling others to run a file called \"ts3client_linux_x86\". That's swell, and all, but that file just flashes a terminal on my screen for less than a second. So I set about trying to capture it on a print-screen to as to actually read what it's saying.</p>\n\n<p>After about 5 or 6 minutes of trying, I finally managed to immortalise Bigfoot's purple and white box of a brother, only to find out that kid's back at it again, and this time he's got his phasers set to acronym. In the picture is the message: </p>\n\n<p>\"This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin \"xcb\".</p>\n\n<p>Available platform plugins are: xcb.</p>\n\n<p>Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, I've never installed a Qt or a xcb and never intended to, as I've never heard of them before, so I assumed it was telling me to reinstall the TS client .run thing again. I got the same message every single time I did it, so now I was lead to believe it wants one of these plugin things. \"Off to google!\" I shouted, it blissful, blissful ignorance. My adventure was far from blissful.</p>\n\n<p>I've stumbled into the cave of monsters that seem really really fond on talking a language only they know - they also seem to enjoy building doors into their cave in some vehement attempt to be as open as possible while becoming more confusing than discerning why Suarez has the munchies.</p>\n\n<p>They all spoke gibberish. Every single thread I found. Nothing helped and no one seemed to be getting the idea that what they were on about is useless to the people asking them questions. When a kid asks you what life means, you tell them something simple like \"having fun\" or \"making your mark on the world\"; you don't tell them it's an existential crisis that mankind has faced for eons as the answer is entirely subjective, then leave them wondering what \"exissensul cry sis\" means - the rest of your drivel long forgotten.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>tl;dr, what body part of this OS do I need to suck to get something working? What's xcb and qt and where do I get some? Can anyone speak in a language that's universal, or will I need to look up google translate Linux > English?</p>\n\n<p>I'm on 12.04. It's dual boot, my main being Win7. I want TS3 not TS2 (TS2's on the software centre).</p>\n"}]}]
