Although, I can easily logon with the Guest account, but I am unable to do anything with it, since I have never used or configured it before.</p>\n\n<p>I tried running <code>sudo nvidia-xconfig</code> from the shell, but it had no effect.

So I did that and was able to access the desktop correctly again with launchee/menu by creating a new account.
