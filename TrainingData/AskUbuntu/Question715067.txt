I booted off a USB stick and had it install alongside Windows rather than over top of it. It installed perfectly, bootloader was great, etc. I decided I didn't like the version of Linux I had chosen, so without looking up a tutorial I went to remove Linux. On the windows side I deleted the Linux partitions, but didn't do anything about restoring the windows boot loader.</p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly (in hindsight), I couldn't boot into Windows, and got grub command line every time I attempted. Using a Windows recovery disk I attempted to fix it with the recovery console commands <code>bootrec /fixmbr</code> and <code>bootrec /fixboot</code> neither of which worked. I got to a bootable Windows by reinstalling the OS overtop of everything. Never saw grub command line again. However, <a href=\"http://imgur.com/DWPxCl7&amp;Np6J3UR&amp;B9APWRG&amp;g6bNeuG\" rel=\"nofollow\">there are still traces of Ubuntu in certain places</a>.\nIn UEFI, the Hard Disk is specified as using Windows Boot Manager which I found peculiar. So I opened the Hard Disk BBS Priorities and sure enough there are two ubuntu options. I also noticed that if I go to Advanced Startup in Windows, choose Use a Device, ubuntu appears twice as an option.</p>\n\n<p>So far the steps I've taken to try and fix this are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using recovery console, <code>rebuildbcd</code> which failed</li>\n<li>Using command prompt, <code>bcdedit</code> which returned no entry about ubuntu</li>\n<li>Mounting the EFS partition of C: and deleting the ubuntu directory (failed)</li>\n<li>Going into msconfig to delete Ubuntu. <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/g6bNeuG.jpg?1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ubuntu wasn't present.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After a few days of googling I am completely out of ideas for what I can search for to find tutorials for this specific problem, because I'm not familiar with the places I'm finding ubuntu traces.
