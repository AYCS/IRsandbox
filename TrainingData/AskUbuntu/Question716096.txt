I tried to install a VPN PPTP type and was able to access the server, but not go outside of the server to internet. Installing Squid3 I also found myself with no internet access.

First I connect to a Mikrotik RB750 router. Then a NAS server (NTFS) is available and I can see, open, edit or save everything what is there. There is no connection problem of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I browse files on NAS and open them locally, responses are very slow. It takes a lot of time to switch to subfolder or back. </p>\n\n<p>When I do exactly the same thing within Windows XP (on the same machine, PPTP, Mikrotik, NAS, browse folders) the responses are much quicker (like 10 or 20 times quicker).</p>\n\n<p>I tried different file managers in Ubuntu, but with no succes. No matter what I use, browsing through folders on NAS is painstakingly slow.</p>\n\n<p>I checked what connection speed do I get with on-line speedtests when connected through VPN PPTP to Mikrotik router. Ookla gives me only about ½ speed comparing to what I get when I try the exactly the same thing with Windows XP. </p>\n\n<p>I am trying to solve this for a couple of months now, but no succes.
