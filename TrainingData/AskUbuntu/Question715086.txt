(Is sleep the same thing as suspend?) I'm not even sure which of these things it's doing. When I am done working for the day, I lock my screen (Control-Alt-L). When I come back the next day, the screen is in power saving mode, and no amount of typing or clicking (on the usb keyboard/mouse or the builtin keyboard/trackpad) nor tapping the power button will bring it back to life.</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can get my machine to work is to hold down the power button until it shuts off, then press the power button again to turn it back on. Obviously, anything I had open from the previous day is pretty much gone -- in particular, my VMs all get rudely shut down without any warning.</p>\n\n<p>This is driving me INSANE. I spend the first hour of every work day trying to figure out how to get my computer to stop locking up over night.</p>\n\n<p>What I've tried:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Editing the org.freedesktop.upower.policy to disable suspend and hibernate.</li>\n<li>Setting power management options in \"Power\" section of \"System Settings\".</li>\n<li>Looking at all power management options in the BIOS (none appear to be relevant to sleep/suspend/hibernate).</li>\n<li>Reading every forum post/askubuntu post that I can find that's even tangentially related to the subject.</li>\n<li>Add acpi=off to kernel args.

I don't care if it's still possible to sleep/suspend/hibernate/whatever by pushing buttons or running some command or reciting led zeppelin lyrics backwards. I just want my laptop to be ready for work in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>*The laptop is a Dell Latitude something or other. I don't want to get too specific because I've seen a lot of similar questions get closed for being too specific.

I've seen a few posts that say buggy video drivers can cause problems with waking.</p>\n\n<p>Last night, on a hunch, I tried switching to console (ctrl+alt+1) before leaving work, just to see what would happen. This morning when I woke up the computer, it instantly woke up back to the console. I switched over to Gnome (ctrl+alt+7) and although the screen looked frozen, I typed my password, pressed enter, and made some coffee. When I got back a few minutes later, my desktop was ready, just like I left it last night.</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to keep trying this to see if this is a reliable solution.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 2:</p>\n\n<p>No dice. Switching to the console after logging out does nothing for me... still have to reboot my computer each morning. It's driving me nuts... I can't believe how erratic suspend is on Ubuntu. Or the fact that it can't simply be disabled. </p>\n"},{"id":64933,"title":"Prevent temporally suspend/hibernate from script?","body":"<p>Is there any way to prevent temporally suspend/hibernate from a script?</p>\n\n<p>I want the screen to enter in powersave mode when appropriate, but the computer doesn't stop. \n<code>Caffeine</code> doesn't allow this: it disables all or nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Why I want to do this?
