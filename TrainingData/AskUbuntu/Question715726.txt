after unplugging), while the battery still reports 99% charge and drops from 2:30 hr to 1:30 hr, the energy usage goes from 8.34 W to 13.54 W and the current_now increases, but shouldn't it be using less energy in battery mode since the screen is much dimmer and it's in power saving mode? (or is that normal behavior?)</p>\n\n<p>It also seems to drain more quickly than what it predicts, especially with the 1-1.25 hour drop in the first minute of being unplugged, which seems odd.</p>\n\n<p>What really concerns me is that Ubuntu 12.10 may not be properly managing the battery (with the sudden change in charge/life from 2:30 to 1:30 or 1:15 within a minute of unplugging), and that a new battery may quickly die under Ubuntu 12.10.</p>\n\n<p>I'd greatly appreciate any advice/suggestions on what to do, and especially whether there's a way to get back the 1-1.5 hrs of battery life that were suddenly lost when changing from WinXp to Ubuntu 12.10.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks :)</p>\n"},{"id":59718,"title":"How do I get rid of double battery monitor status?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/65803/two-battery-indicator-symbols-how-do-i-get-rid-of-one\">Two battery indicator symbols, how do I get rid of one?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems there is a bug that displays an extra battery monitor in Oneiric. From what I found, it is not right in the panel, but in the wallpaper.
