For the most part,APT is\n  easy to use for installing, removing, and updating packages. In rare\n  instances, often when you are mixing in third-party dependencies,\n  there is a chance that apt-get may end up giving you an error telling\n  you that a package installation could not be completed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I doubt there is anything rare about my situation. In fact the very reason I tried to install boost is because i know it should be a no-brainer, and i wished I would have some success with it before installing openscenegraph, which I will actually need. I wanted to try whether the basic things work, and it has let me down. please help instead of dupe-closing my question against the \"general solution\" I tried that, but at some point I have no Idea what the answerers are talking about i.e:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Disable/Remove/Purge PPAs:</p>\n  \n  <p>PPAs (Personal Package Archive) are repositories hosted on Launchpad.\n  You can use PPAs to install or upgrade packages that are not available\n  in the official Ubuntu repositories.</p>\n  \n  <p>One of the most common causes of unmet dependencies are PPAs,\n  specially when used to upgrade the existing package in Ubuntu\n  repositories. To solve the problem you have tree options, disable,\n  purge (revert back to original package in Ubuntu repositories) or\n  remove PPA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my specific question is this:</p>\n\n<p>I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS this very day.\nI installed codeblocks, g++, build-essentials, no problem.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to <code>sudo apt-get install openscenegraph</code>, it may have worked although I cannot locate the header files on my hard drive(maybe I should have downloaded the <code>openscenegraph-dev</code>(but it doesn't exist))</p>\n\n<p>So I chose to install boost to see if this package installer works in the first place and I got(unmet dependencies) what I pasted above.</p>\n\n<p>Why it doesn't work and how can I get it to work?</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<pre><code>apt-cache madison libboost-python-dev\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>returns:</p>\n\n<pre><code>libboost-python-dev |   1.48.0.2 | http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/precise/main amd64 Packages\n</code></pre>\n"},{"id":664447,"title":"OpenCV installation dependencies issue","body":"<p>I am trying to install OpenCV on ubuntu 14.04.
