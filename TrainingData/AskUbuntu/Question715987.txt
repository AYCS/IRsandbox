Recently, no matter which Linux distribution I install, it will randomly freeze to a point where the cursor is frozen and it doesn't respond to any keyboard input, including alt+sysrq (when the system isn't frozen I can alt+sysrq REISUB and it will reboot). There are no answers in <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/4408/what-should-i-do-when-ubuntu-freezes\">What should I do when Ubuntu freezes?</a> that appear to 'work' in this situation.</p>\n\n<p>I've triggered the freeze with the following systems: Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 14.10, Ubuntu 15.04, Ubuntu 15.10, as well as Fedora 22 and 23 (all 64 bit versions). \nIt happens with XFCE, Unity and even Gnome, it happens with nouveau and different versions of the proprietary nvidia driver. \nIt can freeze even as early as during the installation, or during a live session. Sometimes the system will run for 5 minutes before freezing and sometimes two hours. \nThe same hardware can run a Windows operating system for days without issues.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried setting up Kernel Crash Dump, but it doesn't seem to trigger when the system freezes. There are no entries in syslog or kern.log that appear to have been written just before the freeze. On some freezes, the last entry in syslog or kern.log was 30 minutes earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Update:\nI have disconnected a wireless network card as well as a USB webcam, will let the machine run over night to see if one of those is causing it. Will update with results.</p>\n\n<p>Update 2:\nIt froze again. I'm literally out of ideas. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Update3: \nSome hardware specs that might be relevant:</p>\n\n<p>Motherboard: Sabertooth 990FX R2.0</p>\n\n<p>CPU: AMD FX-8350 Black Edition</p>\n\n<p>GPU: GeForce GTX 660</p>\n\n<p>Update3:</p>\n\n<p>I have recently upgraded the bios of the Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 to Version 2501 (the latest version currently available), without any luck.</p>\n\n<p>Update 4:</p>\n\n<p>I've ran a memtest for 9 hours, several passes and not a single error. There are two DIMMS seated in slot 2 and 4 on the motherboard. I have now tried removing the one from slot 4, and will see if I can reproduce the freeze. Will swap them around afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Update 5:</p>\n\n<p>It has run for many hours without freezing so far, I'm finding it hard to believe myself. It might be solved, but I don't understand why. I guess I'll try and give it a few days to be sure.</p>\n\n<p>Update 6:</p>\n\n<p>There have been no freezes, and I must conclude that they were caused by faulty memory. Since the memtest didn't show any errors, chances are I would've never figured out what was wrong had I not started disconnecting 'random' parts. Is this the best approach really? If someone can write up a more systematic way to go at something like this, perhaps with troubleshooting from within Ubuntu, I will award them the bounty.</p>\n"},{"id":688703,"title":"Ubuntu Unity 15.04: Black Screen at Login","body":"<p>I have already researched solutions to fix this:\n<a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/243043/after-logging-in-theres-a-black-screen-and-my-cursor-nothing-else-in-ubuntu\">After logging in, there&#39;s a black screen and my cursor, nothing else! in Ubuntu 12.10</a>\nBut I have more questions that need to be answered.

The same this is happening here in Unity after running a system update and then rebooting. I installed Unity on my laptop a few weeks ago and used the Nvidia proprietary driver as indicated in the Software and Updates window under Additional Drivers. Using that I have no problems. Only when I add the xorg-edgers ppa to my repositories and then executing a system update as notified does this problem occur. I used the same ppa in Ubuntu Gnome which generated the same problem. This time in Unity I didn't even install anything form the repository so I don't know why this happens. I could be making assumptions based on the correlation I see between adding the ppa, running updates, and then rebooting with a black screen before login.</p>\n\n<p>QUESTION: <Br>\nHow do I get access to the terminal to start trouble shooting the black screen nonsense if I can't get a login screen? Lately my beset solution is to clone the drive before this nonsense happens and image it back if it does break.</p>\n"},{"id":663998,"title":"Ubuntu freezing but cursor moving","body":"<p>I just got a dell inspiron 17R with 8gig ram and 1 terabyte hardisk.

The list of drives is replaced with the same message for every entry : \"Please select the booting drive\" which won't do anything; so, I have to enter the Bios every time in order to boot Ubuntu and switch the Hard Drives boot priority.
