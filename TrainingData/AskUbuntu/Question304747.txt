As soon as I did that (right before I was going to click on the <code>permissions</code> tab to change file permissions) Nautilus crashed and this was outputted on the terminal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ERROR:nautilus-properties-window.c:1839:schedule_owner_change_timeout: assertion failed: (NAUTILUS_IS_FILE (file))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After doing some research I understand that this is a bug in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
