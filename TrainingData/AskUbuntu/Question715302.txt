The scanner is an Epson V200 perfection. \nFor the drivers( my computer is 32bit), I went <a href=\"http://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/searchModule\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and in this order, I downloaded and installed:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    1. `iscan-data_1.34.0-1_all.deb`\n\n    2.iscan_2.30.1-1~usb0.1.ltdl7_i386.deb\n\n    3.iscan-plugin-gt-f670_2.1.2-1_i386.deb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After that, the scanner worked in both simple scan and image scan. However, the white fields in pictures were now light blue(not solid though), and the lines of the pictures had a strange double effect in blue and red lines. Almost like you're looking at a 3d image, without the 3d glasses. I'm assuming it's a driver issue, and from the few old threads I've seen, there may not be a fix. I thought I'd try and post here for any ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Below is actually one of the better results I've gotten from scanning. I just scanned a random text sheet(photos are a lot worse).
