I also have an PowerColor Radeon R9 270 TurboDuo installed.  When I first got the PC to work, the monitor displayed 16:9 1080p using Gallium 0.4  on AMD-PITCARIN.  The PC detected and was using my integrated graphics (Radeon HD 7800).  Now, when I turned on the PC the next day after updating the computer, the system details said it was using Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.4, 128 bits) and my monitor's display is now locked at 1024x768 4:3.  I also recently tried to install drivers for the R9 270, but that didn't affect anything, even though it is installed </p>\n\n<p>Driver is:(AMD Radeon Software Crimson Edition 15.12 Proprietary Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 Minimal Video Driver for Graphics Accelerators (Non-X Support). Also, I was using DVI-D when the PC was working correctly.  I switched to HDMI when the problem started, but nothing changed.  The connectors were connected to my discrete GPU (R9 270), but it used the integrated graphics, even though I now have the drivers.</p>\n\n<p>I tried removing llvm 3.4, but the terminal said it wasn't installed, although the System Details said it was using llvm 3.4 .  I would like a suggestion on how to solve the monitor problem (locked resolution) and my graphics problem (not detecting discrete GPU even with drivers installed).</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":696556,"title":"Ubuntu 15.10 is Mirroring my monitors and the settings are unchangeable","body":"<p>Just to preface, this is the most annoyed I have ever been in my life and I'm kind of on the verge of a mental breakdown because my dual monitors are ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL in my homework filled life.</p>\n\n<p>I have Ubuntu 15.10 and up until today my dual monitor setup worked just fine.
