Doing this appeared to fixboth my sound and my microphone issues.</p>\n\n<p>However, once I opened Sound Settings, the sound stopped working. I looked on pavucontrol, and the profile for Built-in Audio had returned to what it was prior, 'Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output + Analogue Stereo Input'.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have any idea of how to solve this issue?
