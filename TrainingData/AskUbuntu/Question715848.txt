I don't want to have to result to using Virtual Box as I want the actual operating system to boot from. I am using refind and rEFIt as it boots as the one and I have the option to boot to the other. I have tried to use a wireless DVD drive but I found out it doesn't work and I don't have the time or money to buy a USB optical drive.
