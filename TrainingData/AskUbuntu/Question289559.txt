Before I installed Ubuntu, they (the website) have given me a help list that shows that I <strong>will</strong> have the option of having Windows aside to Ubuntu (dual install), while I work with the Ubuntu OS. They told me that if I either put it in a CD or USB drive, I'll be okay.</p>\n\n<p>So there I was, installing Ubuntu, saving the Ubuntu file on my USB drive first, then afterwards clicking it and therefore proceeded to install.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is once I installed Ubuntu, it directed me to the 'login' page <strong>without</strong> giving me an option for dual-installing (you know, the language portion and so on). Now I tried both to suspend and shut off, and it seems like I cannot access my Windows files/account anymore and it really is unfortunate. </p>\n\n<p>Now I am FREAKING out, because this is a shared computer that my family uses (it's like a main computer in the house) and <strong>everyone's</strong> files are on this. It is extremely crucial for me to get these Windows files back because if I don't, my life will end tonight. </p>\n\n<p>Please, if someone can help me, I will love you forever. Please just help me, this is <strong>urgent</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>I'm sure a lot of people have experienced this too, but I have found nothing on the website helpful for me as Ubuntu is a very new thing for me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone! :)</p>\n"}]}]
