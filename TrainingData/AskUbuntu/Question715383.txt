However, when I use the task switcher (<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>), which is configured to list large image models of the running applications, some of the icons are displayed with lower resolution compared to others. For example, in my case, this problem can be seen with the <em>Google Chrome</em>, <em>Skype</em>, <em>Mozilla Firefox</em> icons.
