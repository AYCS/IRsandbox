I would prefer to have it go as painlessly as possible, but also to load/run as many of my current apps as possible.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, Mint is basically a distribution of Ubuntu, so I was wondering if the directions I found for <a href=\"/q/62340\">migrating a laptop form one Ubuntu install to another</a> would work.</p>\n\n<p>They basically tell me to use Synaptic Package Manager to save the \"markings\", and then to copy these folders (except using my user name, of course):</p>\n\n<pre><code>/home/aaron/.config  \n/home/aaron/.gconf  \n/home/aaron/.gnome2  \n/home/aaron/.gnome2_private  \n/home/aaron/.local  \n/home/aaron/.mozilla  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are a few things I want to save, such as music, downloads and pictures, but besides that, can I pretty much follow the same instructions and have a full, clean install of Mint, since(As I understand it) they are almost the same OS?</p>\n\n<p>One of the guides wanted me to copy everything in <code>/home</code>, which is like 100 GB... </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any suggestions, I just don't want to hose anything by using outdated tips, or I would have just used the closed post from a few years back as my guide.</p>\n"},{"id":668130,"title":"Ubuntu not starting post cuda installation","body":"<p>I am running Ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 8.1 on an HP Envy 15 laptop having Nvidia gtx 850m graphic card.

When I executed the file, it reported some error (which I don't remember). However, on searching online, I found a solution which asked to stop the <code>lightdm</code> service and then execute the file. I did so and the installation worked perfectly fine. However, I did not restart the <code>lightdm</code> service and tried to switch from the ubuntu text mode to the GUI mode. On pressing the combo <code>Ctrl+Alt+F7</code> the screen went dark with a cursor blinking on left hand top. After waiting for a while, I forced shutdown using the power button. </p>\n\n<p>When I rebooted, I was stuck in the Ubuntu login loop problem. After extensive searching , I tried the following steps</p>\n\n<p>a) dpkg reconfigure lightdm</p>\n\n<p>b) remove and reinstall lightdm</p>\n\n<p>c) install gdm and set it as default manager (for the concerned process)</p>\n\n<p>However, none helped. </p>\n\n<p>But after certain attempts, even the login screen stopped appearing. Now there is a black screen with a cursor on left hand top. After a few seconds, the screen seemingly refreshes and again the cursor starts blinking. </p>\n\n<p>Now, is there any solution by which I get my ubuntu working without having to reinstall a fresh copy?

I went over to the Ubuntu website and downloaded the .iso for the 14.04.1 LTS and then used Universal USB Install (Version 1.9.5.9) with the setting ticked to format the flash drive in question during the installation of the .iso on the drive. </p>\n\n<p>I proceeded to go into the BIOS and swap the boot-order so that the WD HD would be up front and then I manually booted into the flash-drive. I installed Ubuntu onto the WD HD and then it installed just fine. However, at the end of the installation, it says that a reboot will be necessary in order to finish installing the OS. I press to confirm this and the computer reboots. However, after POST, it simply gives me a blinking cursor which starts at the top of the screen then skips down a bit and hangs there blinking. </p>\n\n<p>I am unable to press any keys or key combinations mentioned in any other discussions.
