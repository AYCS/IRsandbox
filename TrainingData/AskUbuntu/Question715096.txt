Based on the results of that, what do I do next?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT 3: Still waiting on my chance to get onto the windows system (my Dad's laptop and he's busy using it).

If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2\nfilesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock\nis corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:\n    e2fsck -b 8193 &lt;device&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I repeated the fsck using e2fsck and the -b 8193 modifier, and got an identical result. Is this information helpful to anyone?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I have been unable to use chkdsk on a Windows environment to recover the disk. I did something to it--I'm not sure what. But, the data lost is not life-ending, thankfully. So, I will continue to investigate this issue on my own, and if I come up with a solution I will repost this question, and all relevant information.

When I am in the office, I can mount this drive to ubuntu since I have added to the etc/fstab file:</p>\n\n<p><code>//192.168.178.30/user /home/user/DISK cifs auto,iocharset=utf8,user=user%password 0 0</code></p>\n\n<p>Is there a similar, easy &amp; safe way, to do the same when I am out of the office using the static IP of the fritzbox router?</p>\n\n<p>I have already added tcp port forwarding in the router for ports 8080 (to 80 of the disk) and 8443 (to 443 of the disk).</p>\n\n<p>I have activated also port forwarding to 445.</p>\n\n<p>Results are till now:\n... <code>cifs auto,iocharset=utf8,port=445,user=user%password 0 0</code>\nUnable to find suitable address.</p>\n\n<p>... <code>cifs auto,iocharset=utf8,ip=192.168.178.30,user=user%password 0 0</code>\nmount error(115): Operation now in progress\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)</p>\n\n<p>... <code>cifs auto,iocharset=utf8,port=445,user=user%password 0 0</code>\nmount error(112): Host is down</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when I do a port scan remotely at the Fritz!box router, there is no reading for port 445. Maybe this is the cause of the problem. Does anyone know how to open it (port forwarding of port 445 to the 445 port of the disk is activated)?</p>\n\n<p>I have also tried to manually change Fritz!box settings as described <a href=\"http://www.ab-weblog.com/en/open-ports-135-137-and-445-in-avm-fritzbox-routers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> but still during port scan on the router 445 port is not shown.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance</p>\n"}]}]
