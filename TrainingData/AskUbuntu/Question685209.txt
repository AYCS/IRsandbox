[{"id":685209,"title":"Uninstall Intel Graphics for Linux 1.20 on Ubuntu 15.04","body":"<p>I recently installed Intel's Graphics Drivers for Linux in my Ubuntu machine sometime last two weeks ago. So then yesterday, I played Minecraft after some months and noticed that it goes to 100% CPU after some time (5mins after starting the game or so, and this doesn't happen a month ago) . I tried a bunch of tests including changing <code>intel_pstate</code> CPU governors, tinkering settings in Minecraft, and now I am suspecting Intel's Graphics Drivers as the culprit. I want to test it out and uninstall the installed/updated binaries by the Intel Graphics Installer. How can I revert it back to what are the drivers/binaries installed before installing Intel Graphics Drivers? (There are some old threads here but I'm still not very good with Ubuntu, I only began using last March and I'm not very sure whether I can still do what other threads suggested on my 15.04 machine)  </p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for the help!</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":660933,"title":"Intel HD graphics driver for 15.04","body":"<p>I want to install the intel graphics HD driver on my Ubuntu 15.04 system.
