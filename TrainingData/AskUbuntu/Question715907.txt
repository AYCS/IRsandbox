I have two drives - both are encrypted with LUKS. The secondary is for my home mount, and the primary for all others. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously the default ubuntu-logo theme works fine.</p>\n\n<p>case 1) Full-screen theme obscures passphrase input for LUKS:</p>\n\n<p>I followed this guide (copy+paste basically) <a href=\"http://www.ubuntugeek.com/quick-tipplymouth-themes-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ubuntugeek.com/quick-tipplymouth-themes-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html</a> - the section of creating a very basic theme.</p>\n\n<p>The image I have used is a 1920x1200 image (a copy of my desktop background). Which is black with logo in the middle.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to work ok, on shutting down, the image shows; on reboot the image pops up, and then the boot process appears to hang. I discovered though that it is waiting for my disk encryption passphrase. I can type my passphrase and the system boots as expected. However, I don't seen any notification to enter passphrase or a text box to enter the passphrase into.</p>\n\n<p>case 2) modifying the ubuntu-logo theme doesn't help</p>\n\n<p>I figured there were a lot of callbacks I needed to make, so rather than writing my own, I'd copy the ubuntu-logo theme to a new dir, and modify it. In this case, I create a small logo file the same size as the ubuntu_logo.png file, and then saved them to the correct directory (overwriting the copy of the original ubuntu_logo.png file). Thus I didn't edit the ubuntu-logo.plymouth or ubuntu-logo.script files (though I gave them new names)</p>\n\n<p>On shutting down, i see the new screen as expected - basically the standard ubuntu one with a new logo. The progress dots update properly as well. </p>\n\n<p>On reboot though, the LUKS passphase screen is shown exactly as for a default ubuntu-logo plymouth theme!</p>\n\n<p>case 3) using the same scripts as in case 1, but resized images</p>\n\n<p>I figured the black screen might be obscuring the passphase box, so in the .script file, i resized the background image to 0.5 in both x &amp; y. This worked as expected on shutdown... but again, the luks unlock screen was as for a default ubuntu-logo theme!</p>\n\n<p>any ideas? im stumped right now.</p>\n"},{"id":605952,"title":"How to make an animated plymouth theme and apply it?","body":"<p>I know how to customize the default plymouth theme and also I know how to install other custom theme I could download from gnome-art and some websites.
