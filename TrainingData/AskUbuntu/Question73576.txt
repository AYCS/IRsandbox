I have changed the title bar color and added borders.  However, I can't figure out how to successfully change the font colors of the text in the title bar.</p>\n\n<p>Making changes to the \"color\" and \"text-shadow\" affects the font colors, but I can't get them to be plain white.</p>\n\n<p>There are two things that might help me to understand what is needed.</p>\n\n<p>The default Radiance theme has this these entries for the UnityDecoration.top:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>color: shade (@dark_bg_color, 0.4);\ntext-shadow: 1px 0 shade (@dark_bg_color, 1.06), -1px 0 shade (@dark_bg_color, 1.06),\n             0 1px shade (@dark_bg_color, 1.06), 0 -1px shade (@dark_bg_color, 1.06);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have tested lots of combinations of those two entries to try to get the text to be white.

But nothing I do can make the font color appear all white.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the problems lies in my understanding the meaning of the 1px and -1px references.</p>\n\n<p>If someone could suggest something that would produce white fonts to the default Radiance theme, I could probably use that as a reference and figure out the meaning of most of the other entries in the section.</p>\n"},{"id":414344,"title":"How to add a session type button to lightdm-webkit-greeter theme?","body":"<p>I'm experimenting with the webkit greeter for lightdm.

It's linked to <a href=\"http://people.ubuntu.com/~robert-ancell/lightdm/lightdm.js\">this javascript file</a> which fakes lightdm for the web mockup. So maybe I can try putting a modified version of the HTML file in a directory and call that the theme directory ...
