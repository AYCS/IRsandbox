System Display GUI can see both displays but can only mirror the displays successfully. By fiddling with Display GUI and ARandR, I temporarily managed to get an extended desktop working, but NVidia GUI still only sees one of the monitors and if I try to reboot with 2 monitors attached, the GUI is totally glitched and unusable after login.</li>\n<li>During boot, the system just uses the left monitor (via HDMI i/f) for display, so I presume this is treated as the primary display. However, after boot, it appears the system switches to using the Display Port for the primary display and the system will not let me have the Ubuntu launcher only on the left (HDMI) display. The only options that work are for having the launcher on both or just on the right (Display Port) monitor. I tried to forcefully fix the issue with the primary monitor incorrectly being set to the right monitor by changing the primary monitor switch in ~/.config/monitors.xml, however this does not work and causes both monitors to appear at strange resolutions and glitch badly with uncoordinated mouse input.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Running  <code>/usr/lib/nvidia-340/bin/nvidia-xconfig --query-gpu-info</code> gives</p>\n\n<pre><code>Number of GPUs: 1\n\nGPU #0:\n  Name      : GeForce GT 650M\n  UUID      : GPU-...\n  PCI BusID : PCI:1:0:0\n\n  Number of Display Devices: 1\n\n  Display Device 0 (DFP-0):\n      EDID Name             : DELL U2412M\n      Minimum HorizSync     : 30.000 kHz\n      Maximum HorizSync     : 83.000 kHz\n      Minimum VertRefresh   : 50 Hz\n      Maximum VertRefresh   : 61 Hz\n      Maximum PixelClock    : 170.000 MHz\n      Maximum Width         : 1920 pixels\n      Maximum Height        : 1200 pixels\n      Preferred Width       : 1920 pixels\n      Preferred Height      : 1200 pixels\n      Preferred VertRefresh : 60 Hz\n      Physical Width        : 520 mm\n      Physical Height       : 320 mm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running <code>xrandr --query</code> gives</p>\n\n<pre><code>Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3120 x 1920, maximum 16384 x 16384\nDP-0 connected primary 1200x1920+1920+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   ...\nDP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nLVDS1 connected\n   1600x900       60.0 +   40.0  \n   ...\nDP1 disconnected\nDP2 disconnected\nHDMI1 connected 1920x1200+0+0 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   ...\nHDMI2 disconnected\nVGA1 disconnected\nVIRTUAL1 disconnected\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running <code>lspci | grep VGA</code> gives</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107M [GeForce GT 650M] (rev a1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My xorg.conf is almost empty but I believe 14.04 automatically detects those settings.</p>\n"},{"id":682646,"title":"getting xorg.conf right for double gpu setup","body":"<p>I used the Nvidia X Server Settings GUI to activate a 3rd display for my desktop, as it was the only software that seems to detect that display which I attach to a second Nvidia graphics card just installed.</p>\n\n<p>After a restart, two monitors become part of my desktop, whereas the third one gets the mouse pointer when moved to, but remains blank other than a special X sign for wherever the mouse is moved on it; it isn't playing as part of the desktop.</p>\n\n<p>Also, after the restart, the two old monitors are now acting as a single monitor - any maximized window will stretch over both of them, which was not intended.

First, I'll describe what I want to do:</p>\n\n<p>I want to run two monitors on my desktop PC, I want to drag windows between the monitors, just as I would in a windows PC setup using the \"extended display\" option.</p>\n\n<p>The issue began with an observation: that with two graphics cards running two displays independently (using the open source ATI drivers) I observe a flickering/disappearing mouse pointer and very sluggish system performance. Unplugging a monitor removes the issue. Hoping that I could solve the performance issue by using proprietary drivers, I switched to them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I install the proprietary drives using the \"additional drivers\" option, I find that the system has completely disabled one of my cards (as observed via the amdcccle GUI). When I enable, through amdcccle, and reboot, I find that my <code>xorg.conf</code> is overwritten during boot up, again, one card is disabled. When I fix this issue (via commenting out the \"start\" lines in my <code>/etc/init.d/gpu-manager.conf</code>) I find that the changes I make via amdcccle are now persistent between reboots.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I enable the card and successfully detect the monitor, I find that on reboot, I see my desktop on one monitor, and on the other monitor, I see a flat black display, which shows a small \"X\" instead of a mouse pointer, when I mouse over to the monitor.</p>\n\n<p>Enabling Xinerama complicates the issue - both of my monitors now show my desktop background, and I can log in via either, however, unity never starts. The only way I can get back into a bootable desktop environment is restoring the <code>xorg.conf</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>I'm quite confused, and have never encountered this issue when running two monitors off of one card. Because of my available cables, and because I have two cards, I'd like to run a display off of each card independently.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the output from <code>lspci | grep -i VGA</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
