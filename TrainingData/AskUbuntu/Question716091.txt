(I had been using KDE 4 on my previous 14.04 installation, and I missed it.)</p>\n\n<p>I had a few initial issues with the install, which failed because \"baloo was not going to be installed\", then I found this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt install kubuntu-desktop baloo-kf5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which did appear to force an upgrade of baloo, and I was then able to install KDE using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and I selected the LightDM display manager. I didn't have any version of KDE installed at that time, so I added:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I didn't run anything else, or fiddle with any configurations. </p>\n\n<p>Everything seemed to be working perfectly - I had KDE Plasma 5, and very good it looked. I could swap between Unity and KDE desktops on the login screen. I used KDE for a couple of hours, then I shut the machine down.</p>\n\n<p>When I restarted it, the GRUB menu looked different - plain black/white instead of colored text on a purple background.</p>\n\n<p>Booting into the Ubuntu login screen gave me a black screen with the cursor arrow in the middle - a problem other people have reported having after login. I could still log in, as the keyboard input position was in the password box as per normal, but on logging in I got a blinding display of jaggy horizontal lines in the pinky-purples of the KDE desktop start-up screen, which changed to similar jaggies in the colors of my desktop wallpaper after a few seconds, but the screen was still completely unreadable, Alt-F2 worked (I think) but the display was still unreadable, and I had to use REISUB to get out. </p>\n\n<p>Rebooting made no difference. I have GRUB set up to dual boot with Windows, and once I got into Windows the graphics were fine, so my assumption was that the KDE install had changed the Linux graphics drivers, so I went into recovery mode and a root command line and tried <code>fglrxinfo</code> to see if there was a clue in the graphics card info, but that came back with <code>command not found</code>. </p>\n\n<p>I had a look around the forums, etc. and I've tried a few things in recovery mode, such as renaming the <code>~/.kde</code> and <code>~/.cache</code> directories, which made no difference. I eventually tried removing the KDE desktop with</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That appeared to work, but after a reboot there was still no difference at all, and judging by the colors of the jaggy lines I was still logging into the KDE desktop. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not able to swap to Unity in the display manager because of the black screen - I have tried but I can't see what I'm doing. Basically, my Ubuntu install is now unusable for all intents and purposes.
