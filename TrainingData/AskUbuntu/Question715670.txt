[{"id":715670,"title":"How can I select which battery discharges on my laptop?","body":"<p>So I have two batteries in my work laptop, Lenovo T450s. I have Ubuntu Mate 15.10 on it. It always discharges one of the batteries before going on to the next one. Is there any way to set thresholds such that, for example, one battery will drain to 80%, then it will switch to the other until it hits 80%, and then do that continuously? Currently it will drain one battery to 5% before switching to the other battery that is at 100%.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":686041,"title":"How can one force the laptop batteries to charge beyond their recognized limits?","body":"<p>My thinkpad has two batteries delivering approximately 200Wh.

No overheating","body":"<p>I'm using a Dell Inspiron 5520 laptop with a 3 month old battery. I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS version recently and I'm completely new to the Linux world. I've noticed that the battery is draining drastically fast when compared to Windows where I used to get at least 5 hours. There is not overheating though. I've tried to find a fix in various questions posted in this forum but couldn't find or understand an appropriate solution.

For instance, you could listen to your [device] for a few hours one day, using half its power, and then recharge it fully. If you did the same thing the next day, it would count as one charge cycle, not two, so you may take several days to complete a cycle. Each time you complete a charge cycle, it diminishes battery capacity slightly, but you can put [device battery] through many charge cycles before they will only hold 80% of original battery capacity.
