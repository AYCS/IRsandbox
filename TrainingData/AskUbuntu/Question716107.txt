Wow, and I really did love this OS at one time. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET PASS THE BLACK SCREEN SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING. CAN SOMEONE AT LEAST TELL ME HOW TO GET IT UP? SO I CAN AT LEAST SEE THE SCREEN AGAIN? I NEVER HAD ONE PROBLEM WITH 12.04 UNTIL I HIT 12.04.2 AND 13.04. I've never had this problem until recently and don't know if it has something to do with Ubuntu being on a SATA HDD and LinuxMint 14 on a IDE HDD.</p>\n\n<p>When I move my mouse to awake the computer, the monitor light goes from orange to blue so I know the monitor comes on - however the screen is solid black. Sometimes when I restart I watch my HDD light when it stops blinking. I'm guessing its at GRUB menu so i press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, then it will come to my first option to allow to sign in which I can see, and sometimes it doesn't. I have HDMI, but I'm running DVI. I can't see my first option in GRUB, I just press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and then I see my <em>sign in</em> screen.</p>\n\n<p>After several times of pushing the <strong><em>restart button</em></strong> on my computer it finally comes up, but it takes quite a few tries.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>When I am on LinuxMint HDD, the same thing happens there as well.<br>\nI have a Radeon HD 6500 graphics card and tried several different drivers (open source and proprietary), but nothing fixed it. I am now using AMD Catalyst 13.4 driver, which works great, except for this issue.</p>\n\n<p>I've researched Google and tried a few things but nothing works and this is getting very old fast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does anyone know how to fix this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the computer goes to sleep and I wake it within 3 minutes, it comes up fine, with no issues, but if it goes to sleep for awhile, an hour or so, it has this issue.</p>\n\n<p>I am using the 3.5.0-28-generic kernel as well as the newest quantal x stack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Checking my BIOS</strong> -  I am already set to \"s3\". I'm not really sure I want to suspend to hard drive since suspend to ram was working. I have also tried the \"<code>acpi_sleep=old_ordering</code>\" trick in Grub boot options to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>To add to this, when I added LinuxMint, on second HDD I unplugged my SATA HDD from computer that had Ubuntu on it, then installed LinuxMint 14 on the IDE HDD. Once installed, I then plugged my SATA drive back up and ran <code>sudo update-grub</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As I've been reading more on Ubuntu 12.04.2, I wonder if when my kernel and <em>xorg</em> stack updated to quantal if this is my issue... <strong>Is there a way to roll back to an older kernel to test this?</strong> I can't remember correctly right now, but this issue might have started when I put <strong>LinuxMint 14 on the IDE HDD and thats equivalent to Ubuntu 12.10, right? Could this be the issue?</strong> The new <em>xorg</em> and kernel? Although my boot priority in BIOS loads my SATA drive which has 12.04 Ubuntu on it first anyway, but also has been updated to the new quantal kernel. I set a <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=KmSud966\" rel=\"nofollow\">link here to my xorg file</a>, hoping it might help some as well.</p>\n\n<h1>Update 1:</h1>\n\n<p>I just tried to run <em>memtest</em> from Grub menu, and I get an error \"<code>too small lower memory (0x99100 &gt;0x99800)</code>\". The test doesn't start and I have 2 entries of <em>memtest</em> in Grub2. I am running 8gigs of ram, gigabyte socket 775 board, quad-core setup. I'm not having any crashes, my memory shows up in system monitor.<br>\nI've just researched this issue. Seems its a bug, but <strong>would it affect my S3 setting in BIOS?</strong></p>\n\n<h1>Update 2:</h1>\n\n<p>Just switched from S3 to S1. It Doesn't work neither.<br>\nI've noticed in my <em>xorg</em> log file that I'm receiving some errors </p>\n\n<pre><code>(EE) open /dev/dri/card0: No such file or directory,,,,,\n(EE) open /dev/fb0: No such file or directory,,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for fglrx,,,,,,,\n(WW) fglrx: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:0@1:0:1) found,,,,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for vesa,,,,,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for modesetting,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for fbdev,,,,,\n(WW) fglrx(0): board is an unknown third party board, chipset is supported......\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also upgraded to 13.04 and still fighting this issue.

Not even BIOS or Grub. However, I assumed that Ubuntu was highlighted in the Grub and pressed <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Then I see my HDD light lit up, then hear the Ubuntu chime. I attempted several reboots, for about 30 minutes. Then I become frustrated on last attempt and did this - while my computer was running I unhooked my DVI cable from the graphics card and then hooked it back up. And all of a sudden I no longer had the black screen. I could see my desktop finally. <strong>Does this help anyone out there to help me fix this issue?</strong><br>\nAnother thing I've noticed is my LinuxMint HDD is <code>/sda1</code>, while my Ubuntu SATA HDD is <code>/sdb</code>. <strong>Should the Grub be on <code>/sda1</code>?</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/88Wqf.png\" alt=\"syslog\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/88Wqf.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">This is my syslog picture</a>.</p>\n"},{"id":308442,"title":"How do I install cinnamon on Ubuntu raring?","body":"<p>How do we install cinnamon in Ubuntu raring?\nI added <code>deb http://packages.linuxmint.com/ debian main import backport upstream romeo</code> \nto the sources list and used <code>apt-get update</code> to update the sources.</p>\n\n<p>The result was :</p>\n\n<pre><code>Fetched 523 kB in 1h 0min 24s (144 B/s)\nReading package lists...
