GRUB2 should be working because during the restart after installation it starts GRUB2 and I select Ubuntu.

If I put back in the installation USB or disk it does not recognize the external either at the GRUB2 menu and asks if I want to install. </p>\n\n<p>Most solutions online have to do with secure boot which I don't believe I have.
