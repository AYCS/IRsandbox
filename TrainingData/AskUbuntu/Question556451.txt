So the first step to that is to unzip the downloaded installation archive and then run ./install as superuser. When I do that, ideally the Matlab interactive installation launcher should come up on the screen and guides you through the installation. However when I do this, my terminal displays the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$./install\n\nPreparing installation files ...\n\nInstalling ...\n\nFinished\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the interactive launcher never shows up, and neither is Matlab installed when I check for it. These lines appear rather quickly (1-2 seconds) on the terminal, so it seems improbable that Matlab has been installed in any form.</p>\n\n<p>I tried installing on another machine from the same installation archive I downloaded, and the installation launcher comes up immediately.

(14.04 LTS, btw)  I’ve built and used my Ubuntu box solely as a development machine to (re) learn coding – mostly java.  I have two primary issues:</p>\n\n<p>1)  I can’t find any advice on a standard directory to install programs, so I’ve tended to use either /opt/ or /usr/lib.  Is that ok?</p>\n\n<p>2)  I seem to run into recurring problems with file and directory permissions when trying to install/use applications.  </p>\n\n<p>From what I’ve read, there is no ‘standard’ for installation directories (and apt-get seems to do it’s own thing), so what do experienced folks do?  Any good practices you can recommend?</p>\n\n<p>The permissions problem consistently gives me the irits, and I usually end up going into the terminal and sudo the hell out of everything, or using chmod/chown.  But, I think this kind of defeats the purpose of having these permissions.  Is this a common issue, or did I miss a step when I built my box?  Or, worse yet, did I somehow screw up my standard permissions?</p>\n\n<p>For example, I installed eclipse and spring (STS, roo and security).  To do the spring security tutorial, I had to install tcserver, so I put it under /opt/.  However, I couldn’t set it up or start it through eclipse until I changed the ownership permissions on the entire install and server directories.  This can’t be normal.\nThat said, I installed maven without a hitch.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"id":655410,"title":"how to install ap-hotspot in ubuntu 14.04?","body":"<p>I am trying to install using this commands</p>\n\n<pre>$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install ap-hotspot</pre>\n\n<p>I get the following error:</p>\n\n<pre>sudo: unable to resolve host limberlink-lp6\nReading package lists...
