[{"id":584243,"title":"Ubuntu Touch - emacs gets &#39;fatally&#39; stopped in terminal if user switches away to other touch applications","body":"<p>Here is my problem: I start 'emacs' in latest Ubuntu Touch running on Nexus 7. Then I swipe to switch to Unity desktop and there I launch, say, browser. Then I swipe again and switch back to terminal where I now see \"Stopped\" word in the middle right across the now frozen emacs text interface. Now the process is listed as stopped by <code>jobs</code> command and I try <code>fg %1</code> to bring it back to foreground. Unfortunately what I get is just some codes now start appearing across the screen every time I press any button from the moment I launched the <code>fg %1</code> command. Sometimes I get parts of emacs interface appearing on the screen but this is it. I am unable to recover my application back into the working state.</p>\n\n<p>So here goes the questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are there better ways to recover applications stopped in terminal by the system?</li>\n<li>Are there ways to prevent application from being stopped by the system?
