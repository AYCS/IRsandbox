The issue isn't with permissions and I've uninstalled-reinstalled both GDM and lightDM many times. The only thing I can think of is there is something up with my lightdm config file but all I have in there is autologin and user-session=gnome. Also there is nothing in .xsession-error.

I needed to change ownership of several (sudo-related) files. I used <code>pkexec</code> to change ownership using the terminal. I now realize that this shift in ownership may be the cause of my loginloop problem. sudo does work now, so I'll try some other commands.
