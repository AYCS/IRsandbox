Basically, my computer connects to the wifi (which is fine, I'm on my Chromebook now to post this on the very same wifi), but it won't access the internet.</p>\n\n<p>I'm on a new Lenovo G50-30 (with rtl8723be chip), and running Ubuntu GNOME (I think 14.01, but I'm not sure. A friend installed it for me. As you might suspect, I'm not good with these things). I'm starting to get desperate here, I don't have a lot of money, and don't want to have wasted it on a computer I can't access the internet on.</p>\n\n<p>Apperently, my Chromebook refuses to read the text file (even after uploading it to Drive) in which I put the ifconfig output, but I'll work on it so that I can post it here.</p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate any help at all!</p>\n"},{"id":337078,"title":"Why can&#39;t I browse internet while downloading torrent or updates?","body":"<p>I've recently switched from Windows to Ubuntu since I was windows 7 made my laptop very slow. </p>\n\n<p>I thought updating Ubuntu before I start using it properly would be the best option, but when I start updating, I cannot browse the internet anymore. </p>\n\n<p>The same happens when I'm downloading a torrent or installing an application from Ubuntu s\nSoftware Center.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to fix this?

I have no idea what's going on. The internet says it is connected but I can not get on the internet at all. I have restarted it over and over and still nothing. I don't see any errors and the only time it worked was when my friend tested it with ethernet. After that, nada. Please help me. I don't want to end up breaking the thing by either pressing the wrong thing or throwing it against the wall, which I am considering if I can't make it work. Lol. Not really though. But still.
