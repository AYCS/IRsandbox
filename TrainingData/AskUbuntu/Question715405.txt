I normally run preinstalled windows 8.1 on my Lenovo IdeaPad P400 touch, and I decided to try out dual booting Ubuntu 14.04, having never used Linux before. I edited the UEFI to disable Secureboot (and I think Fastboot) allow Legacy support,  (this was the only way to get UEFI to recognise my LiveUSB, which I made with YUMI <a href=\"http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/</a> on Windows 8.1) and modified the boot priority to boot USB and Optical drive before my HDD. I managed to access Ubuntu on the LiveUSB, and even install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1 without a hitch. Ubuntu runs just fine, and I can even choose between Ubuntu and Windows 8 on GRUB, but Windows 8 now returns a boot error in both normal startup in recovery mode. And now, I cannot get the computer to recognize my LiveUSB (freshly made from the same .iso I used with YUMI, created through Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator). </p>\n\n<p>I do have a backup of all my files and even a system image (created with W8 built in tools) on an external HDD. I also have access to an older Windows XP Desktop, and am fairly confident in my ability to take apart my laptop, if necessary (although admittedly I have only done this with a desktop). </p>\n\n<p>I suspect that what happened to kill my W8 install is that I installed Ubuntu on the same partition that W8 exsists on, rather than the partition I had created with Windows Disk Manager, although I have no experience with Linux or dual booting, so I may be way off base.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for recovering my Windows 8 install? At this point, I would just like to have Windows 8 back and running properly, with or without Ubuntu. I do have my W8.1 product key (taken from a product key extraction program, Belarc, I believe), and I can reinstall all of my important programs if I have to start over. </p>\n"},{"id":492314,"title":"Ubuntu failed to load - black screen","body":"<p>Mine was a dualboot Ubuntu/Windows desktop.</p>\n\n<p>Just then there was a black screen which appear after loading up the \"Ubuntu\" symbol.
