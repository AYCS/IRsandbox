The Windows USB Tool only installs the different versions of Windows, while UNetbootin installs just about everything but Windows. One needs the flash drive to be formatted as NTFS, the other, Fat32. Could I partition the flash drive to make it work with both USB tools?

I used the live cd to install and was pretty sure I changed the boot loader installation to the usb stick, but apparently I didn't. Atleast thats the only way I could see this happening. I restart my computer and it gives me a list of options to boot from, windows, ubuntu, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Thats not what I wanted, I wanted to only boot ubuntu when I selected the usb stick. I boot back up the live cd and redo the usb installation being extra careful. Now I can boot the usb like I want to. But I can't get into windows or figure out how to get rid of this grub thing.</p>\n\n<p>I had two hard drives attached at the time, an ssd with my windows 8 installation and an hdd with some files. I unplugged the hdd and grub still appears so I guess the ssd is what I need to worry about.</p>\n\n<p>I tried inserting my windows repair disk and running all of the bootrec commands and nothing worked. Then I tried installing the boot-repair tool on the linux live cd and ran the recommended settings and that didn't do anything. I also installed the os-uninstaller and it didn't show me a list of os's, it automatically wanted to wipe the windows bootloader or something.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, here is the file the boot-repair tool generated</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/11927180/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/11927180/</a></p>\n\n<p>When my computer starts it says GNU GRUB version 2.02, minimal bash-like etc</p>\n\n<p>then</p>\n\n<p>grub>_</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if I try to boot from the ssd, it says reboot and select proper boot device.
