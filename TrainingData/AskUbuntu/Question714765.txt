[{"id":714765,"title":"Some programs don&#39;t see other partitions","body":"<p>I tried to get some photos from my second internal HDD (native SATA at Chipset) to <a href=\"http://melloristudio.com/wallch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wallch</a>.

I experienced the same with <a href=\"https://obsproject.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OBS</a> and <a href=\"http://peterlevi.com/variety/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Variety</a>, so I think it is an Ubuntu problem.

I did previously have both the 12.04 (Samsung) and 8.1 (then on the 1TB) drives plugged in together for a dual-boot to windows/ubuntu.  However, I wasn't using windows, so I cloned the Samsung to the 1TB drive to upgrade to 14.04 which was eventually cloned to the 3TB drive for a backup. </p>\n\n<p>Samsung was original HDD with 12.04 LTS and partitioned as:<br>\nsda1  fat32       /boot/efi        380 MiB  4.11 MiB used<br>\nsda2  ext4        /                 24 GiB 12.48 GiB used<br>\nsda3  linux swap                     8 GiB<br>\nsda4   ext4       /home            200 GiB  (remainder of Samsung HDD)</p>\n\n<p>Background:<br>\nThe Samsung drive was operating normally with swapon running 12.04 when I decided to upgrade to 14.04.  I ran Clonezilla disk-to-disk to copy the Samsung to the 3 TB drive, leaving the extra space blank.  I upgraded the  3TB to 14.04 3 different times. (I kept crashing 14.04 with various tweak tests.) Finally, I cloned the 3TB to the 1TB to keep a backup of 14.04.  All three drives worked!</p>\n\n<p>I decided to upgrade my windows HDD (Seagate 160GB) to Windows 10 so I removed my Ubuntu HDD and disconnected my external USB drive and plugged in the Seagate.<br>\nI changed the BIOS boot to Secure-On to boot windows.\nI ran the updates to Windows 8.1 (which took 8 hours.) I unplugged it and plugged in my 1 TB drive. I did not switch from Secure-On to Secure-Off in the BIOS and got a screen dump (see problem) when I tried to boot. I changed it back to Secure-Off and was able to boot, but was unable to use the NIC with Ubuntu.  I tested with all three Ubuntu drives and had the same results.  Windows still used the NIC with no problems. (another problem that was solved).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I tried to boot the 3TB drive with the Windows 8.1 recovery USB plugged in (Meant to have the 14.04 plugged in) and the computer booted 14.04 with the NIC working. It also worked when I had any UEFI formatted USBs installed (12.04, 14.04 live or win8.1.) But, without the USB it would crash.  </p>\n\n<p>I was also getting a UUID device failure error at boot time.  I identified it in the fstab as follows:<br>\nswap was on /dev/sda3 during installation\nUUID=227f2961-6f7e-4027-ac44-e045fc7e026a none            swap    sw              0       0  </p>\n\n<p>I commented it out and rebooted.  The UUID error was gone, but without the USB plugged in, I still got the screen dump problem. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, I turned swapoff in gparted and could boot without the USB plugged in.</p>\n\n<p>Problem:<br>\nWith swapon when Ubuntu boots after Grub, I get a multi-page \"dump\" of some sort that pauses awhile and then scrolls again periodically.  It does this for hours, but I don't have the patience to see when it might end, so I end up hard-crashing to turn off the computer. </p>\n\n<p>This will continue until I insert any USB flash formatted with UEFI plugged in.  I don't have to boot to it, just have it plugged in.  Then, Ubuntu boots with swapoff.  I can then unplug the USB, reboot and everything works.... until I turn swapon again.</p>\n\n<p>Attempted Solutions (1TB drive only):<br>\n - format swap partition\n - delete and recreate swap partition<br>\n - delete sda3 and create sda5 formatted as swap<br>\n - resize swap partition</p>\n\n<p>I tried deleting and moving swap partition around.  No matter what I do, with swapon I get the screen dump when booting and cannot boot without inserting a UEFI USB.  With swapoff, everything seems to work properly.  My 12.04 works the same way as well.</p>\n\n<p>Other than turning swapoff on the Samsung or 3TB drive, I have not experimented with them looking for solutions. </p>\n\n<p>** On my active drive, the 1TB, I did extend the /home partition to 400 GB and create a 500GB partition for backups.  During that change, I tried again to create a swap partition and had the same results. When I find a solution, I will resize the /home partition and add the swap partition.  In the meantime, I will be using the 3TB for experimenting until I find the solution.</p>\n\n<p>*** I read numerous questions about swap problems and find nothing that matches this one.</p>\n"},{"id":623935,"title":"Neuroimaging Use: How big for partitions (root, home, swap) and some other Qs","body":"<p>I will be using my Ubuntu for neuroimaging use. This is my first time using -- I've been using Macs for the last few years so am not familiar with using Ubuntu on a regular PC. A few questions: Are root, swap, and home partitions necessary?

The advice given has been quite scattered and confusing thus far, so I'd like to confirm this here. I guess the more ideal choice would be to boot Windows from Ubuntu and not the other way around.
