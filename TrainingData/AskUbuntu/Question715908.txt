But to keep my old software, I did not format the usr n opt for which I've separate directories. Afterwards, I mounted them in their positions and edited/etc/fstab to get back my previous state .. of course I had to install mono again, since I guess it's stored in bin, lib, et al, rather than usr/bin, usr/lib, et al .. every software is working perfectly as expected. However, I had no idea that the dpkg stuff aren't stored in usr. (/var, /etc was &amp; is in the same partition as / )\nHence, I can't upgrade my kernel or other stuff .. is there any way to make apt-get check all the software in usr and update it's lists, and maybe correct the dependencies of they are available under the repos in /etc/.../sources.list?\nOf course, I must add the required ppas, and reinstall stuff outside usr, such as some compilers.\nFurthermore, just a suggestion in the wrong place I believe, can't there be 2 or more extra lists, in usr &amp; under /, which store the names of the packages installed under it, and cross location (in or out of usr) dependencies, so that apt-get accesses them such that in case someone does something like what I did, apt searches the list and updates it's main list?</p>\n"},{"id":707101,"title":"How to reset Ubuntu installation","body":"<p>How do I reset my Ubuntu installation just like it's freshly installed (like factory reset), with my files being intact and without a reinstallation.</p>\n"},{"id":695959,"title":"Mediainfo will not reinstall","body":"<p>I'm new to Ubuntu.
