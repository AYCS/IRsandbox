What I usually do is to use the mouse (yuck!) to click on those arrows to do the scrolling. How can I achieve the same behavior using the keyboard?</p>\n\n<p>Now I know we can use shortcuts to scroll through tabs by opening them, for example with <kbd>Ctrl+PgUp</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+PgDn</kbd>. However, this implies opening the tab and I do not want to do that. I have multiple groups of tabs with a few of them containing dozens of tabs. When I close Firefox and come back they do not load automatically. So if I'm in a tab in position 57 and want to go to a tab in position 33 by using <kbd>Ctrl+PgUp</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+PgDn</kbd> then all tabs in between are loaded. When I use the arrows instead the tabs do not load and the tab which has the focus is still open although it is not currently showing on the tab bar. In the end, the final tab selection would still have to be done using the mouse but it would be convenient to do the scrolling with the keyboard.</p>\n"},{"id":558580,"title":"How can stop tab wrapping in terminal?","body":"<p>I am using Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, and when I have a terminal open with multiple tabs I can cycle through them (for me, using Shift + arrow keys).  Currently it will wrap around the edges, meaning that if I am on tab 1 and hit Shift + left, it will go to the last tab, and vice versa.  I don't want that.  I don't want it to wrap.  Searching for this question led me to someone else who asked this question for 9.04, and the answer was to add the line <code>gtk-keynav-wrap-around = 0</code> to ~/.gtkrc-2.0 .  This file did not exist for me, so I created the file and put only that line in it.  However, after restarting my machine to ensure any changes would be pushed through, it has not helped anything.
