I can't break it!  For instance, if I copy <code>/usr/bin/okular</code> to <code>/usr/bin/fooooo</code> and call that new executable, the window thus created still gets the okular icon, even though there is no <code>fooooo.png</code> or <code>fooooo.desktop</code>, or any <code>.desktop</code> with <code>Name=fooooo</code> or <code>Exec=fooooo</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Where is the association between the executable and the icon made?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>NOTE: The point is not for the icon to appear on the desktop.\nIt makes no difference to me whether it appears there or not.<br>\n(My desktop shows the contents of my home directory.)</p>\n"},{"id":471502,"title":"Stop/Avoid overlapping desktop icons?","body":"<p>I am running Ubuntu 14.04.
