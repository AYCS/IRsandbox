After increasing the height of the xfce-panel I noticed, that the icons of the window buttons remained small. Because this looks stupid and makes recognizing the icons harder than it has to be I want to increase the icon size of the window buttons of my xfce4-panel. I am running Linux Mint 14 Xfce, but this should affect everyone running Xfce 4.10.</p>\n\n<p>The xfce docs tell me that I <strong>\"can set a custom icon size in gtk-icon-sizes with the name panel-tasklist-menu. The default icon size is 16px\"</strong>. -- <a href=\"http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-panel/tasklist\">Source</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell this can be done in a few different ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Using the graphical Settings Editor to customize the settings stored by Xfconf to add in the xsettings the Property IconSizes <code>panel-tasklist-menu=32,32</code> (Or maybe just <code>panel-tasklist-menu=32</code>)</p></li>\n<li><p>Editing <code>~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xsettings.xml</code> directly, doing basically the same thing</p></li>\n<li><p>Adding <code>gtk-icon-sizes=\"panel-tasklist-menu=32,32\"</code> to <code>~/.gtkrc-2.0</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Adding this to the <code>gtkrc</code> of my theme (<code>/usr/share/themes/Mint-X/gtk-2.0/gtkrc</code>)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As you can guess nothing worked. Now after a while of blind trial&amp;error trying to guess the correct way to define the icon size, I surrender. I was able to change the size of pretty much all the other icons on the panel, but still the size of the window button icons eludes me.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone an idea how I can increase the icon size of the xfce4-panel window buttons?
