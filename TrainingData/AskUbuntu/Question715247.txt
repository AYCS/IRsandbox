And the dangerous part is that even if the command is suggested on a Ubuntu help page, the page itself <strong>says it's outdated at the top and should not be used</strong> various times.</p>\n\n<p>This is the official prompt (and starts with the command typed). Can you tell me if it has damaged my machine? I'm thinking that it may hve installed very old softwares, because the instruction was in the tutorial wich was not recomended.
