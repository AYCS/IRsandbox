Apart from the essential problem of finding exactly the best way for my personal case to add space to this partition, there are MANY details about the info displayed on GParted (or other disk managers) that I am unsure or completely ignorant about, as many, many other people are. \nThis gets confusing mainly because the partitions were created sort of \"by themselves\" through the process of trying out different desktop environments, and/or distros (which is what one is supposed to do, right?).Nevertheless, this is probably one of the biggest issues for Linux for average users, as you might know. One dives into installing and updating Linux distros and then, try to get a hold of all the software one needs, and eye candy one would like, but as you do, the need for deeper knowledge keeps getting bigger and bigger. This is frustrating, especially when you want to promote the expansion of Linux for all users.</p>\n\n<p>So, I guess, after taking a look at all previous related answers on here (which btw were not exactly easy to understand, the question(s) would be this: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>what is exactly the info on my GParted screen? ,</li>\n<li>how did these partitions get created? ,</li>\n<li>what is dev, sda, sda1,sda2, when were they created, what are they for? ,</li>\n<li>what are partition flags, all of them? ,</li>\n<li>should I change them? ,</li>\n<li>what is unallocated space, how did it get created? ,</li>\n<li>why is it in between 2 partitions (in my case)? ,</li>\n<li>why is it only 1Mb (my case)? ,</li>\n<li>how does one know how to properly manage existing partitions? ,</li>\n<li>if I have no more space for updates, how do I add more to boot partition?</li>\n<li>does always depend on each case, isn't there a method one can safely use in ANY case?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, all of these questions arise from a look at the GParted screen I am attaching, so, can you answer this?, can you link to a usable, as written by a teacher (for 8 y/olds), guide?, would you want to help creating such a guide?</p>\n\n<p>I know this is kinda freaky, a lot maybe, but apart from my current space issue, it has been on my mind for long that something needs to be done in terms of help material to really assure the expansion of Linux, and all open source software for that matter.</p>\n\n<p>Haters gonna hate, bla, bla, \ncheers!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/GWItF.png\" alt=\"GParted screenshot\"></p>\n"},{"id":673811,"title":"Hard-Disk Partitioning: Please Help Me! :(","body":"<p>Guys i am new to linux and all that stuff.
