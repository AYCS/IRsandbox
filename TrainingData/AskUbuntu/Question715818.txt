I got everything working fairly easily, including several different VPNs, but this last one is giving me issues.  </p>\n\n<p>I have one client that uses the Aventail VPN via a web interface (Internet Explorer).  I tried the simple way of hitting it through firefox and that definitely did not work.  On my Windows machine there are three packages installed - Aventail Access Manager, Aventail Web Proxy Agent and Aventail Webifiers.  These get installed when you login to the SSL VPN via IE.  I believe they are all just plugins for the web browser.</p>\n\n<p>In Windows I normally just login to the site via IE and then I have a link to a remote desktop that I can launch.  There is no desktop program to run.</p>\n\n<p>But for Linux I found netextender and thought it might work for connecting to this VPN based on what I have read.  I got it installed successfully and can launch it (GUI or command line) but it keeps giving me an Authentication failure when I try to connect.  I know the information I am passing it is correct so something else is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>My first question is if netextender is the right client to use for this type of VPN access (Aventail SSL VPN that is normally accessed via web - not sure if the web portion is important or not).  If it is not is there something better available?</p>\n\n<p>My next question will be that if this is the right path to follow, what can I do to further debug this and get it working?</p>\n"},{"id":592241,"title":"VPN client for Ubuntu 14.04","body":"<p>I was used to use Kerio VPN client <strong>on Windows</strong> for VPN connections.\nWhat client do I have to use?
