I know this is possible because I have this configuration working on a different machine, but I don't believe anything special was performed to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>I have Ubuntu 14.04 64bit installed on my laptop, and have removed gnome-screensaver using \"sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver\".  I've added an entry to the startup applications to run \"xscreensaver -no-splash\".  If I wait 5 minutes, the screensaver starts up as expected, however when I move the mouse I find it returns me to an unlocked session.  In case you're wondering, yes I'm waiting until after short timeout where it would otherwise allow me to wake up the session without needing to type your password.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried playing around with various configurations under System Settings / Brightness &amp; Lock.  The options I've tried setting are ensuring that \"Lock\" is enabled, and setting \"lock screen after\" to 5 minutes.  However this seems to have no effect.  I was actually wondering if this was due to the removal of gnome-screensaver.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried following the steps under the apps man page, however it requests me to modify /usr/share/applications/gnome-screensaver-preferences.desktop which doesn't exist (I believe because gnome-screensaver-preferences is no longer shipped with gnome-screensaver, and is uninstalled in any case).</p>\n\n<p>I then found a slightly different version of the man page here:\n<a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xscreensaver.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xscreensaver.1.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Under the GNOME heading it asks you to modify the same file as before, that also doesn't exist.</p>\n\n<p>I'm at a bit of a loss really.  I would have thought that if xscreensaver was configured to not lock the screen, but have Ubuntu configured to lock the screen, then the 2 should work together.  So I'm wondering if they're conflicting somehow?</p>\n\n<p>Appreciate any and all help.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"id":457204,"title":"How can I lock the screen using the new lockscreen from the command line?","body":"<p>Ubuntu 14.04 introduces <a href=\"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/03/unity-lockscreen-ubuntu-14-04\">a new lockscreen</a> that looks similar to the login screen.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/d6a7h.jpg\" alt=\"New lockscreen\"></p>\n\n<p>I am still able to lock the screen using the command <code>gnome-screensaver-command --lock</code> (as I always did before), which under 14.04 does lock the screen, but:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you are running it from the desktop, it locks the screen using the new lockscreen.</li>\n<li>If you are running it from a virtual console or via SSH, it locks the screen using the <strong>old lockscreen</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've also tried using <code>xdg-screensaver lock</code>, but it works in the same way as <code>gnome-screensaver-command --lock</code> does (only uses the new lockscreen when it's ran from the desktop).</p>\n\n<p>Running <code>light-locker-command --lock</code> didn't work, as <code>light-locker</code> is not installed.</p>\n\n<p>I guess there must be some differences between running the same command from the desktop and running it via SSH/virtual console, but I was not able to find any difference in the environment variables.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: <strong>How can I lock the screen using the new Unity lockscreen and not the old lockscreen from the command line?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/455926/unlock-screen-in-14-04-without-gnome-screensaver-command\">This question</a> is probably related as it asks for the new command that needs to be used, so here's another question: <strong>Why does running the same lock command give different results?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note that <code>gnome-screensaver</code> is not being used anymore in 14.04, according to <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/1307163\">this bug report</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That's not really a gnome-screensaver bug, that component stopped being used in trusty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":466686,"title":"Ubuntu 14.04 Go to Switch Account without goint through Lock Account","body":"<p>Okay.
