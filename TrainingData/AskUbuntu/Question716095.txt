I know that there is a lot of threads on this topic but I seriously do not know which applies to my case.</p>\n\n<p>I have bought a Dell Inspiron 15 5558 with pre-installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (UEFI). However due to my studies I need both worlds of Windows 10 and Linux so decided to set up a dualboot. A long explanation is as follows.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 1:\nI tried to do as in this thread: <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/666631/how-can-i-dual-boot-windows-10-and-ubuntu-on-a-uefi-hp-notebook\">How can I dual-boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu on a UEFI HP notebook?</a>\nAs preinstalled the laptop had 5 partitions on a 2TB HDD drive: EFI (500MB), DIAGS 40 (MB), OS (3GB), \\home (~1.7 TB), \\swap (32GB). The disk allocation was poor so i tried to resize the partitions and make room for Windows but for some unknown to me reason the live USB didn't allow me to unmount the \\home drive and use GParted.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 2:\nAccording to this manual: <a href=\"http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/dual-boot-ubuntu-15-04-14-10-and-windows-10-8-1-8-step-by-step-tutorial-with-screenshots\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/dual-boot-ubuntu-15-04-14-10-and-windows-10-8-1-8-step-by-step-tutorial-with-screenshots</a>\nI formatted the HDD using Windows installer tool and swiped the partitions: OS, \\home \\swap leaving the other two. I made 300GB room for windows, 300GB NTFS placeholder for Ubuntu and left the rest for NTFS data partition. Windows 10 PRO x64 installed normally from EFI bootable USB. When i tried to launch Ubuntu from EFI live USB it occured that: a) Laptops EFI still recalls the formatted ubuntu, the EFI Ubuntu USB does not launch and in order to start the USB i had to change the boot to legacy mode. I managed to get the Live Ubuntu running, cleared the 300GB placeholder and assigned the root \\home \\swap partitions. For some reason the installer gave me a warning that i need at least 1MB partition at the beginning of the drive for boot purposes (i apologize for no screenshot). The installer didn't allow me to create such partition so I ignored the error and continued the installation. It finnished normaly, however, when setting up boot order I was unable to get the Ubuntu. The screen showed the grub2 command line\nWindows rechognized the partition as non-NTFS and suggested formating.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 3.\nI swiped the windows, ubuntu and ntfs data partitions. EFI and DIAGS are stil in place. According to Windows 10 installer, Ubuntu took the assigned space. I set up a 300GB partition for Windows, the rest for data partition. I installed the Win 10 normally. The data partition was invisible at first, I forgot to format it to NTFS during installation, but I was able to recover the disk space.\nI launched the Ubuntu Live USB to finish the installation. I needed to launch it using legacy boot option instead of EFI mode, because of GRUB2 command line showing up instead of Ubuntu launch screen. Now my laptop is running with Live USB Ubuntu and GParted is doing some magic to my laptop.</p>\n\n<p>What happens now:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>16MB partition that Windows added by itself is now \"not reckognized\"\nwhere as in attempt 2 this partition was FAT32 and recognized as\ngood. </li>\n<li>GParted shows around 13hrs to move and clear the 300GB from 1.5TB drive. It took few minutes for windows and ubuntu installer in attempt 2 to do\nsuch. I can hear the HDD operating while GParted moves the\npartitions around, which gives me creeps and makes me think that the HDD is damaged.</li>\n<li>The 300GB Windows partitions has 322GB according to Live Ubuntu... with 20-ish GB taken by windows and 20-ish GB taken by\nsomething i cannot find.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Am I doing the right thing? I am really concerned to not mess up my new laptop. I think that this will not be covered by the warranty which brings a risk of an expensive service fix.</li>\n<li>If anything should go wrong, will I be able to recover my dell, and the disk space to factory settings without swiping the UEFI and Diags partitions using ubuntu Live USB and a \"clean install option\"?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Sorry for the length of this post but I wanted to provide as much information I could.</p>\n\n<p>Kind Regards.\nJędrzej</p>\n"},{"id":698799,"title":"After Ubuntu 15.10 installation from LiveUSB in UEFI mode, I need to navigate in the UEFI files to locate the grub file in order to boot","body":"<p>I have a new HP Elitebook 840 G1 that was pre-installed with Windows 7.

So, if anyone can help me get it working without losing any of my data on another raid 0.</p>\n\n<p>First of all though, I need to understand how to format and arrange my hard drive for a proper bootloader, cache or whatever is being needed for the os and all the rest to perform properly.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, is about the grub thing. I have followed many tutorials but I always felt am missing something or lack some knowledge to tackle the issue.</p>\n\n<p>If you need information about my pc, its an intel dg45id, xeon l5420, 8gb ram, 2*raid 0 (160gb*2-os &amp; 1tb*2-docs), radeon 7790hd.</p>\n\n<p>Note: both raids are set up using utilities from motherboard at boot.</p>\n\n<p>I wish ubuntu could be easier to install or use but I won't ask more than just a little help for now especially that all this is open source and more reliable.</p>\n\n<p>A step by step assistance would be better. Add me on skype (starrdhm - Heman Mankoo) if need be.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,\nHeman</p>\n"},{"id":486250,"title":"Dual boot Windows 7 UEFI Raid with Ubuntu 14.04 Grub2 Problem","body":"<p>I used the intel Raid 0 to raid SSD #1 and #2 on raid 0 for video editing work, everything was good.I installed windows 7 64bit on an asus x79 deluxe motherboard on these raid 0 two ssds using UEFI+gpt, all went good. </p>\n\n<p>I then installed 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a third non raid ssd # 3 with manual partitioning and I got gpt and UEFI on that and everything is almost all good. I can browse and see the windows raid windows partition but grub2 does not see list windows uefi.</p>\n\n<p>In UEFI BIOS I can select UEFI Windows boot manager or UEFI Ubuntu boot manager and each will boot respectively from their own boot manager.  However I want to add the UEFI Windows boot manger to grub2 so I can select the OS from GRUB2 and not have to go into bios to choose OS.   </p>\n\n<p>How can I do this?  I tried boot repair but it seems to screw things up to the point of reinstall. I wonder is there is a way to manually add the windows boot loader to grub2 and daisy chain UEFI Windows boot manager?</p>\n\n<p>Cheers,\nMartin</p>\n"},{"id":145115,"title":"Ubuntu RAID in UEFI system","body":"<p>I tried to make Ubuntu RAID in UEFI system.
