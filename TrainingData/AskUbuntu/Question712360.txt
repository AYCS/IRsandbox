It's not maximized in the window manager sense, but its dimensions are such that it fills the entire screen.</p>\n\n<p>If from this window I launch <code>gnome-terminal --geometry=80x24</code> I get a second terminal window which is <em>also</em> pseudo-maximized (the output from <code>resize</code> tells me 80x31 on my current screen).</p>\n\n<p>What exactly is overriding my <code>--geometry</code> argument, and how do I disable it?</p>\n\n<p>My end goal is to have applications launch at whatever dimensions their designers intended, so I am not looking for a fix specifically for <code>gnome-terminal</code>.  The list of applications I actually care about is fairly short (Terminal, Emacs, Firefox, Thunderbird, Software Center, settings, etc) but I would like to avoid creating and maintaining a list of per-application \"overrides for the override\" and just get rid of the thing which does the geometry overriding in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>The workaround at <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/613973/how-can-i-start-up-an-application-with-a-pre-defined-window-size-and-position\">How can I start up an application with a pre-defined window size and position?</a> is one prime example of the kind of clean-up I would like to avoid; that is the reason I am asking what causes this, rather than just how I can avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to keep my other settings as much out of the box as possible.
