Yes the device works well with other devices however the moment i move to linux the device sounds like crap unless I turn on the High Fidelity Playback (A2DP)</p></li>\n<li><p>Use ability when designing an operating system like linux its best that you want to make it as user friendly as possible with out having a ton of extra steps.. Just critiquing everyone's code a little.. I personally dont mind installing things like  qemu virtualization stuff like that that is a breeze compared to dealing with blue tooth issues that are absolutely silly in the fact that it works one day the next day it doesnt..</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To give you an idea how much trouble i have had with bluetooth I literally setup qemu virtualization had it up and running no problems with scripts and command line and reading but when i turn to this bluetooth problem their is 1 million results and no real solutions to fix it..</p>\n\n<p>This here is a work around however it is not a solutions!\nThe script i run to get the audio to work only works about half the time..
