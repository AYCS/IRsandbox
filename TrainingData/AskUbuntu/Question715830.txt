For example, doing chmod 1777 /tmp (but those things never made the computer work). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I created a new user and did ls -la /home/alpha:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/home/alpha$ ls -la\nls: cannot access .gvfs: Permission denied\ntotal 148\ndrwxr-xr-x 28 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:35 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 root  root  4096 2011-01-24 13:25 ..\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 alpha alpha   56 2010-08-22 18:46 Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop -&gt; /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.desktop\ndrwx------  3 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:03 .adobe\n-rw-------  1 alpha alpha  449 2011-01-24 12:35 .bash_history\ndrwx------  7 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:35 .cache\ndrwx------  3 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:35 .compiz\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 13:24 .config\ndrwx------  3 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 10:44 .dbus\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Desktop\n-rw-r--r--  1 alpha alpha   41 2011-01-24 12:35 .dmrc\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Documents\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Downloads\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 alpha alpha   31 2010-08-22 18:46 .ecryptfs -&gt; /home/.ecryptfs/alpha/.ecryptfs\n-rw-------  1 alpha alpha   16 2011-01-24 11:48 .esd_auth\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:25 .fontconfig\ndrwx------  5 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:35 .gconf\ndrwx------  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 13:26 .gconfd\n-rw-r-----  1 alpha alpha    0 2011-01-24 12:56 .gksu.lock\ndrwx------  8 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 13:24 .gnome2\ndrwx------  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 .gnome2_private\n-rw-r--r--  1 alpha alpha  137 2011-01-24 12:35 .gtk-bookmarks\nd?????????  ? ?     ?        ?                ? .gvfs\n-rw-r--r--  1 alpha alpha 1026 2011-01-24 12:35 .ICEauthority\n-rw-------  1 alpha alpha    0 2011-01-24 09:08 .ICEauthority.backup\ndrwx------  3 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 .local\ndrwx------  3 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:03 .macromedia\ndrwx------  4 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:50 .mozilla\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Music\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 .nautilus\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Pictures\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 alpha alpha   30 2010-08-22 18:46 .Private -&gt; /home/.ecryptfs/alpha/.Private\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Public\ndrwx------  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 12:27 .pulse\n-rw-------  1 alpha alpha  256 2011-01-24 11:48 .pulse-cookie\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 alpha alpha   52 2010-08-22 18:46 README.txt -&gt; /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.txt\n-rw-------  1 alpha alpha  916 2011-01-24 11:53 .recently-used.xbel\n-rw-r--r--  1 alpha alpha    0 2011-01-24 11:48 .sudo_as_admin_successful\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Templates\ndrwxrwxr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Ubuntu One\ndrwx------  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:51 .update-notifier\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 alpha alpha 4096 2011-01-24 11:49 Videos\n-rw-------  1 alpha alpha 3634 2011-01-24 13:24 .xsession-errors\n-rw-------  1 alpha alpha 4170 2011-01-24 12:35 .xsession-errors.old\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But checking permissions by nautilus it tells me .Private is owned by \"<strong>1016 - user #1016</strong>\"</p>\n"}]}]
