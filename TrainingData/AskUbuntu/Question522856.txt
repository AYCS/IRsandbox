[{"id":522856,"title":"NTFS disk is read-only and I can&#39;t change to read &amp; write","body":"<p>I have used Windows 7 for a long time and thought to give Linux (Ubuntu) a try. I have two hard drives, one 120GB, other 1TB. First one is for OS and software, while the 1TB disk is for data and games. So I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on the 120GB disk (sda) and have done all those 10-things-you-should-do-after-installing-ubuntu. However, it did not want to mount the 1TB disk (sdb) at all saying that it's corrupted, but after two restarts it mounted (...?). I could access all my files but as a read-only disk. I installed GParted and got this message upon right-clicking <code>/dev/sdb1</code> and selecting information:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unable to read the contents of this file system!</p>\n  \n  <p>Because of this some operations may be unavailable.</p>\n  \n  <p>The cause might be a missing software package.</p>\n  \n  <p>The following list of software packages is required for ntfs file system support:  ntfsprogs / ntfs-3g.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since I've been tackling this issue for about 5 hours now, I have heard and came across ntfsprogs and ntfs-3g but have only succeeded in installing ntfs-3g. ntfsprogs refuses to install for various reasons, e.g.</p>\n\n<p>command</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>returns</p>\n\n<pre><code>Reading package lists...

How can I make it read &amp; write? It's an NTFS file system, but it's about 50% full and I can not lose that data. Is NTFS absolutely useless in Ubuntu (or Linux generally)?</p>\n\n<p>Please help</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UPDATE: Windows' disk checker said everything is normal, disk has been about 1% fragmented, and therefore defragmented, but nonetheless, the problem persisted. So I took a few days off to compress everything I had on it and transfered that data to cloud storage (Apple's Time Capsule) via Windows. I formatted the disk (to NTFS) and now it's empty and it indeed IS read&amp;write in Ubuntu. But now I have a problem of being unable to access the Time Capsule from Ubuntu.
