It is essentially, why can't I change my compliance level in Eclipse from 1.6 to 1.7 but I'm going to leave the body of my question as it was typed originally.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a very specific question but I'm going through a series of Java courses online and one of the lessons deals with switch. The example code uses switch with strings (both the course and I use Eclipse). When I try to run the code it gives me an error stating\n\"Cannot switch on a value of type String for source level below 1.7. Only convertible int values or enum constants are permitted\"</p>\n\n<p>I understand this is because strings can only be used with switch in Java 7. Thus I went about installing Java 7 in terminal using some instructions I found online. Afterwards Eclipse wouldn't run at all. I went to switch back to Java 6 and found I was running Java 7 Oracle but had option to change to Java 7 OpenJDK so I did. Eclipse is working again but I still get the same error as before. Why is this? And is there a way to fix it?</p>\n\n<p>For some added info, here's what terminal returns when I type in  \"sudo update-alternatives --config java\" to switch between versions.</p>\n\n<pre><code>glitch@glitch-Inspiron-1720:~$ sudo update-alternatives --config java\n[sudo] password for glitch: \nThere are 3 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).\n\n  Selection    Path                                           Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java         1062      auto mode\n  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java   1061      manual mode\n* 2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/jre/bin/java   1051      manual mode\n  3            /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/bin/java         1062      manual mode\n\nPress enter to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I'm currently using java-7-openjdk where as before I was using java-7-oracle (which resulted in Eclipse plain out not working) and before that I assume I was using java-6-openjdk (this is what I run Minecraft in after all but who knows).</p>\n\n<p>More specifically I'm using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>glitch@glitch-Inspiron-1720:~$ java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_55\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.4.7) (7u55-2.4.7-1ubuntu1~0.12.04.2)\nOpenJDK Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I looked at this question: <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/226044/cant-use-java-7-from-eclipse\">Can&#39;t use Java 7 from Eclipse?</a></p>\n\n<p>I tried following the instructions given therein all the way up to changing Properties > Java Compiler > Compliance Level to 1.7</p>\n\n<p>I found the location of my JVM was /usr/lib/jvm/ but when I put this in for JRE home in Eclipse it gives me this error: \"Target is not a JDK Root.
