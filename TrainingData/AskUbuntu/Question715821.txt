I had to install Windows 7 in order to use a software which isn't available on linux. Windows required me to reinstall ubuntu because the installer didn't want to work if I didn't remove all partitions of the computer (thanks windows). Since that moment, Ubuntu freezes on shutdown/restart, whether it's ubuntu gnome or kubuntu, 14.04 and 15.04.</p>\n\n<p>The only solution I found is an option to change in /etc/default/grub:</p>\n\n<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=warm,cold,bios,smp,triple,kbd,acpi,efi,pci,force\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi=force\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo update-grub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but it didn't work for me.</p>\n\n<p>I wondered if there was a problem with uefi, but my bios is in \"legacy mode\".

The issue does not seem to depend on the OS version: it occurs with 12.04, 13.10 and now with 14.04.

I've tried many things to solve it, but none of them did the job. I have the 64 bit version of 14.04 installed and boot in legacy boot mode with secure boot disabled. The behavior is independent from a power cable/usb device/ethernet cable being plugged in. Strange enough, however, it does sometimes stay powered off after being used for several hours...</p>\n\n<p>I know there have been several treats concerning shutdown/reboot issues, but none of them provides an answer to my specific case.
