One of which was full disk encryption. I've now installed the drivers for my graphics card, but upon system boot, my screen goes black (the normal black screen you face if you have an nvidea card &amp; the drivers are incompatible with the kernel). I know from experience that the first screen you get taken to asks for the password to access the encrypted drive. So with my black screen in front of me, I put in the password to access the drive, and then all of a sudden my graphics comes online. It's almost like the X server process is not loaded in between the drive decryption step and the login screen. Although this actually improves my security because it's just a black screen (hilariously I might add), I would like to know how to get my graphics working before I hit the login screen, so I can see the step for entering the encryption password prior to the login screen.</p>\n"},{"id":691946,"title":"How to solve black screen problem after installing nvidia drivers on Ubuntu 15.10?","body":"<p>I have a Asus K550JK (Ubuntu shows X550JK) with a intel hd 4600 and nvidia 850m.\nWhen trying to install Ubuntu 15.04, the same error nouveau unk06 used to flood,\nI would just set nomodeset to the kernel parameters and install 15.04 and then Just install bumblebee.\nAfter that nomodset would not be needed and my laptop worked fine on ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>But when 15.10 came out, I tried to setup and same nouveau error unk06 started flooding. \nFrom experience I just added nomodeset to boot parameters and installed.\nThen I tried installing bumblebee and after reboot the screen went black after the ubuntu bootloader/loading little circles animation.</p>\n\n<p>So I though bumblebee isnt compatible with 15.10 so I clean installed again using nomodeset. Then went in and installed a propeitory driver from ubuntus Additional drivers section. Upon reboot, same problem, black screen. I tried different drivers and the results were same.\nBlack screen. Some older drivers give a purple screen, nvidia optimus gives a login loop.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what logs I can/need to post since I cant access the laptop as it goes black screen.\nBut I'm sure with instructions I can do it.(It starts fine on recovery mode on a low resolution. )\nAs I use ubuntu just for programming and web browsing and other simple non graphical tasks, I would be happy if I could just use the intel gpu and ubuntu would turn off the nvidia alltogather(if that was a solution that is). But the bios does not have any option for disabling the nvidia gpu.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any other way to solve this except for going back to 15.04? I dont even want to use the nvidia gpu on Ubuntu, the intel internal gpu is all I need.</p>\n"},{"id":670713,"title":"Black Screen With Loading Circle on Boot [DEAD]","body":"<p>I recently updated my graphics driver to a newer one available on AMD's website, but it was beta and it broke stuff. Initially when I booted it would give me the message that X failed to load. Then I booted into safe mode, and tried the response to another question that said to uninstall all fglrx packages and delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf.* and when I rebooted it worked... sort of. Now I don't get the error that X crashed, but I get a black screen with a loading circle in the middle that appears to be the one from the default cursor theme. I can move it with my mouse, but it just sits there forever. I also tried booting replacing \"quiet splash\" with \"nomods\" but that did nothing. I also tried booting with intel integrated graphics instead of my gpu, but it also made no difference.</p>\n"},{"id":672342,"title":"Strange problem: black screen when selecting live ubuntu or install ubuntu","body":"<p>I've putted ubuntu to a flash drive and came to grub menu selected try ubuntu live the screen goes black with some words\"acpi pcc probe failed\" then the screen goes totally black,\n I've tested the monitor on another PC and it worked fine,\ni restarted the PC and came to grub menu again and selected install ubuntu first was the same as selected live ubuntu but the second the setup started fine!!!\n i installed the system and after i finished restarted the PC and again like the first time the screen goes black after i selected the system to boot ):\n i tried to select advanced options for ubuntu then start ubuntu in recovery mode there i selected resume normal boot and it worked and booted to ubuntu fine!!?\nbut i still wondering the reason to this problem??\nmy graphic card is radeon hd 5450 and the hard is gpt\ni tried before installing opensuse but it's the same issue!</p>\n"},{"id":641657,"title":"Gtx 970 can&#39;t boot Ubuntu 15.04.
