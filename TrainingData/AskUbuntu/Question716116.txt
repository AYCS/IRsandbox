It has a Intel N3540 CPU and a integrated Intel HD Graphics GPU. It has a UEFI and I ran dualboot Windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10. Under Windows no problems, but I prefer Ubuntu... While just working and surfing it runs, but when I look at videos (mp4) it takes sometimes only seconds sometimes minutes until the machine full freezes, no keyboard and no ssh access to it. So also no logfiles from the crashes exist. I still tried to change the GPU frequency with intel_gpu_frequency from the lowest to highest value, already switched off bluetooth, but no change... I also still tried the latest evaluation version of Ubuntu with the 4.3 kernel and the 01.org intel drivers but also no change. Does anybody know what to do?
