So here I ask, what would work best? I currently have ONLY Ubuntu 15.04, not running along side another OS. But what's best for me PC? Would you suggest keeping 15.04, getting Ubuntu 14.04, Lubuntu 15.04 or something else?</p>\n\n<p>Question 2: Gaming, it's been asked a million times - but like I said, I'm new so I'm a little oblivious on how to make it work. All I'm trying to do is download The Sims 3 Starter Pack. Bought it brand new, codes and all. If ya' would, I'd greatly appreciate step by step instructions on how to install and play it - hell, I'll Skype you if it's easier than explaining it through text. I know about Wine and PlayOnLinux, but don't know how they work. So I need dumbed-down instructions on how to I install and play it. </p>\n\n<p>Question 3: Considering my PC's specs, overall what Linux should I use? And will I be able to play Sims 3 on it? </p>\n\n<p>I know these questions have been asked before, but I'm certainly no expert on computers. Only got Linux because I dispise Mac and hate Windows, plus it'll further my computer knowledge. So to wrap it up, suggestions on the OS version would be appreciated and how to install and play games would be even more helpful. Answer what you can, I appreciate any advice. Thanks y'all. </p>\n"},{"id":440975,"title":"how to install software offlinely in ubuntu?","body":"<p>I am very new to the Ubuntu.\nI install Ubuntu 13.10 right now for first time. till now I used Window xp. now I want to use Ubuntu (an open source).\nI want to know how software are downloaded in Ubuntu offline (without internet connection)because I have no internet? please guide me in simple &amp; step by step manner.</p>\n"},{"id":622910,"title":"Ubuntu 14.04 install fail","body":"<p>I have a HP Pavilion G60 lap top running Ubuntu 14.04. 2 days ago it upgraded to 15.04 and restarted, now it wont run off the hard drive.
