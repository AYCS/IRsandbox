[{"id":716034,"title":"Dell inspiron 5558 UEFI dual boot problems","body":"<p>This is my second question here so again please forgive if I ask the obvious or duplicate a question. I know that there is a lot of threads on this topic but I seriously do not know which applies to my case.</p>\n\n<p>I have bought a Dell Inspiron 15 5558 with pre-installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (UEFI). However due to my studies I need both worlds of Windows 10 and Linux so decided to set up a dualboot. A long explanation is as follows.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 1:\nI tried to do as in this thread: <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/666631/how-can-i-dual-boot-windows-10-and-ubuntu-on-a-uefi-hp-notebook\">How can I dual-boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu on a UEFI HP notebook?</a>\nAs preinstalled the laptop had 5 partitions on a 2TB HDD drive: EFI (500MB), DIAGS 40 (MB), OS (3GB), \\home (~1.7 TB), \\swap (32GB). The disk allocation was poor so i tried to resize the partitions and make room for Windows but for some unknown to me reason the live USB didn't allow me to unmount the \\home drive and use GParted.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 2:\nAccording to this manual: <a href=\"http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/dual-boot-ubuntu-15-04-14-10-and-windows-10-8-1-8-step-by-step-tutorial-with-screenshots\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/dual-boot-ubuntu-15-04-14-10-and-windows-10-8-1-8-step-by-step-tutorial-with-screenshots</a>\nI formatted the HDD using Windows installer tool and swiped the partitions: OS, \\home \\swap leaving the other two. I made 300GB room for windows, 300GB NTFS placeholder for Ubuntu and left the rest for NTFS data partition. Windows 10 PRO x64 installed normally from EFI bootable USB. When i tried to launch Ubuntu from EFI live USB it occured that: a) Laptops EFI still recalls the formatted ubuntu, the EFI Ubuntu USB does not launch and in order to start the USB i had to change the boot to legacy mode. I managed to get the Live Ubuntu running, cleared the 300GB placeholder and assigned the root \\home \\swap partitions. For some reason the installer gave me a warning that i need at least 1MB partition at the beginning of the drive for boot purposes (i apologize for no screenshot). The installer didn't allow me to create such partition so I ignored the error and continued the installation. It finnished normaly, however, when setting up boot order I was unable to get the Ubuntu. The screen showed the grub2 command line\nWindows rechognized the partition as non-NTFS and suggested formating.</p>\n\n<p>Attempt 3.\nI swiped the windows, ubuntu and ntfs data partitions. EFI and DIAGS are stil in place. According to Windows 10 installer, Ubuntu took the assigned space. I set up a 300GB partition for Windows, the rest for data partition. I installed the Win 10 normally. The data partition was invisible at first, I forgot to format it to NTFS during installation, but I was able to recover the disk space.\nI launched the Ubuntu Live USB to finish the installation. I needed to launch it using legacy boot option instead of EFI mode, because of GRUB2 command line showing up instead of Ubuntu launch screen. Now my laptop is running with Live USB Ubuntu and GParted is doing some magic to my laptop.</p>\n\n<p>What happens now:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>16MB partition that Windows added by itself is now \"not reckognized\"\nwhere as in attempt 2 this partition was FAT32 and recognized as\ngood. </li>\n<li>GParted shows around 13hrs to move and clear the 300GB from 1.5TB drive. It took few minutes for windows and ubuntu installer in attempt 2 to do\nsuch. I can hear the HDD operating while GParted moves the\npartitions around, which gives me creeps and makes me think that the HDD is damaged.</li>\n<li>The 300GB Windows partitions has 322GB according to Live Ubuntu... with 20-ish GB taken by windows and 20-ish GB taken by\nsomething i cannot find.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Am I doing the right thing? I am really concerned to not mess up my new laptop. I think that this will not be covered by the warranty which brings a risk of an expensive service fix.</li>\n<li>If anything should go wrong, will I be able to recover my dell, and the disk space to factory settings without swiping the UEFI and Diags partitions using ubuntu Live USB and a \"clean install option\"?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Sorry for the length of this post but I wanted to provide as much information I could.</p>\n\n<p>Kind Regards.\nJędrzej</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":714430,"title":"how to configure new disk for UEFI boot using grub2","body":"<p>I am using an ASUS N53J that is currently using MBR boot.  I have enabled UEFI booting in the bios can can seem to boot USB drives that have been configured with gpt tables.  Though I have not figured out how to make use of a dedicated EFI boot partition on the USB drive as yet.</p>\n\n<p>Separately I have connected a second  hdd to the laptop via the external SATA connection, created a gpt partition table, esp boot partition, and the filesystem and swap partitions.</p>\n\n<p>When I run grub-mkconfig on the internal hdd, it finds the new linux image on the external hdd.  I can boot to that external image and confirm that the esp boot partition gets mounted at /boot/efi, so it appears that I should be able to configure grub2.  However, if I run grub-mkconfig when executing from the external drive, its own image does not get found, only the linux and windows images on the internal drive.</p>\n\n<p>I also cannot get efibootmgr to run.  The tutorials I have read either are not clear on both the how and the why so I can troubleshoot myself or use commands that I cannot find in the packages I think they are using.

When I choose Ubuntu, the Grub menu comes up. But when I choose Ubuntu (first item) from this menu, it fails to boot. I get the message, \"Booting in insecure mode\", and then it hangs.</p>\n\n<p>This ThinkPad originally came with Windows 7, and it does not have Secure Mode to turn off - no secure mode.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried every boot-repair option, and it is not set up to handle this configuration. I need to edit the Windows and Grub bootloaders manually somehow, but I don't know enough about them to know what's wrong or how to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the output from boot-repair. I wish I knew what any of it meant. I've spent hours and hours on this. Can anyone help me?</p>\n\n<p>Forget that - I can't paste it here because it's too long. Also, I don't know how to put this in a code block - I'm not going to manually type spaces in front of each line!

But in early 2014, Ubuntu 13.04 started booting slow (was not able to list down error messages), until it simply would not boot. I could still boot into Win7 though. Re-installed Ubuntu - using version 13.10 last Feb but mistakenly chose \"Erase disc and install Ubuntu\". </p>\n\n<p>Tried to fix it with Boot Repair and tried reinstalling Win7 but kept getting errors. Used Testdisk to try to recover partitions/files -- it found something, either boot or patition files, which i tried to restore (probably another mistake). Used \"FixParts\", Tried \"fdisk\" and \"gdisk\" but still got errors when trying to partition and format.</p>\n\n<p>After all the tinkering, my laptop ended up with an error on boot, then says \"Operating System not found\". Pressing F2 during boot, i only get to the Phoenix Secure Core Tiano Setup.</p>\n\n<p>Decided to replace and upgrade to a new HDD and additional DDR3 RAM in August. Installed Ubuntu 14.04 but still get “OS not found” error on startup, although pressing F12 brings me to Boot Menu where I can choose Ubuntu. Upgrade to 14.10 did not fix problem. If I install Win 8.1 instead, it boots up fine but won't let me install Ubuntu because I cant go to live USB  :(</p>\n\n<p>Recently tried Boot-repair again, eventually got \"Boot successfully repaired\" message (see <strong>\"<a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/9622340/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/9622340/</a>\"</strong> ) with reminder to “make your BIOS boot on sda1/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi file”. I don't know what it means or how to do that. Only difference is that now I get \"Booting in insecure mode\" message after choosing Ubuntu from Boot Menu (F12).</p>\n\n<p>Help would be really appreciated</p>\n"}]}]
