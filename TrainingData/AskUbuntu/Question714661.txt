My scenario is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>I have one computer running Ubuntu 15.10. It is my primary computer and it runs a few different hard disks, two of importance here: an SSD drive with ext4 with ubuntu installed, and a regular HD with ext4.</p>\n\n<p>I have another computer running Windows 7. I want to access files from the regular HD on the Ubuntu computer (it is used as media storage).</p>\n\n<p>So, using system-config-samba, I now have two shares: /home/Testmapp/ as \"Testmapp\" (meaning \"Test folder\" in Swedish) and /media/jobjorn/Crusher/ (the drive is named after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Crusher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beverly Crusher</a>). Both have my account as the owner, and both are chmod-ed to 777 recursively.</p>\n\n<p>From my Windows computer, I can access the test folder without any problem.
