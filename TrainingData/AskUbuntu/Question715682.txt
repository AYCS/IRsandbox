I use it as a server to host media to my Kodi clients throughout the house. It worked fine with Windows but now it randomly stops the movies.\n I know this is a host problem and not a problem with the Kodi installations. I have switched my driver for my NIC to r8168 and that did not help.\n I run a MySQL server and the native NFS server from this computer. I am not sure where the problem is.\n I do not know what error logs to post or what to look at. The only error that comes up in Kodi is that it is a network disconnect problem. I assume the problem is with the driver for my NIC but again I don't know where to begin.

Normally, I can find the answer t what I'm after with a few simple searches, but I have worked on this off and on for weeks now and am getting nowhere.  Here's what's going on;</p>\n\n<p>I have been trying to get an NFS mount working on an Ubuntu client running 12.04 server.  The issue is that CSF (Config Server Firewall) is blocking the rpc.mountd requests because they are coming in on random UDP ports.</p>\n\n<p>If I go to my client machine (running Webmin) and try to create a mount, I click the button to browse for NFS servers, the window pops up and, after a second or two, says \"No local NFS servers found\".  I check the logs on the SERVER and it shows it blocked the outgoing request on a random UDP port.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Jan 11 17:15:56 kas kernel: [ 5396.470955] Firewall: *UDP_OUT Blocked* IN= OUT=eth0 SRC=192.168.70.5 DST=192.168.70.6 LEN=52 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=55775 DF PROTO=UDP SPT=2049 DPT=44551 LEN=32 UID=0 GID=0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I remove 2049 from the UDP in on the SERVER, I get a blocked port for 2049, so I know the request is received by the server on port 2049, which is where it should be listening, but it's trying to send back out on the port that the CLIENT requested from.  If I click the browse button (on the CLIENT) and do this multiple times, I get a different UDP port block out to the client each time.</p>\n\n<p>If I open up a range of UDP ports from 30000:60000, the server sends back the mount info and the client blocks the UDP in from the server unless I turn off the client firewall or open up UDP 30000:60000 (this is now the same on both machines / firewalls), then everything works.</p>\n\n<p>The strange part is, the CLIENT does not block the initial request to the server on port 2049, FROM a random port, but it does block the same port on the UDP IN when the server sends back info to the client.</p>\n\n<p>I have edited /etc/default/nfs-common and /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server on the SERVER and edited /etc/nfs-common on the CLIENT to manually set ports, as described <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/SecuringNFS\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code># /etc/default/nfs-common\nSTATDOPTS=\"--port 32765 --outgoing-port 32766\"\n\n# /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server\nRPCMOUNTDOPTS=\"-p 32767\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would now expect that the CLIENT would send a request from PORT 32766 to the server on PORT 2049, but it does not appear to be the way it works.</p>\n\n<p>rpcbind appears to be listening where it should TCP is shown, UDP is the same).</p>\n\n<pre><code>111     tcp 4/- -   837     root    rpcbind -w  /sbin/rpcbind\n32765   tcp 4/- -   963     statd   rpc.statd -L --port 32765 --outgoing-por... /sbin/rpc.statd\n32767   tcp 4/- -   2983    root    /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd -p 32767   /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd\n32769   tcp -/- -   3221    root    /usr/sbin/rpc.rquotad -p 32769  /usr/sbin/rpc.rquotad\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, I can see everything works, but I just can't figure out how to set the port that the CLIENT uses to request the info from the SERVER.  I have read page after page of Google searches and can find hordes of information that references the \"random port number assignment\", but do you think I can't find one that helps me fix it.</p>\n\n<p>PORTS 111, 2049 and 32764:32769, both TCP and UDP have been allowed through both firewalls.  As I said, if I allow 30000:60000 through both firewalls, it works, but is obviously not the answer.  </p>\n\n<p>I do appreciate you reading this and hope you can point me in the right direction!</p>\n\n<p>Kyle</p>\n"},{"id":527422,"title":"VPN PPTP disconnects after a random period of time","body":"<p>I can't seem to keep my VPN connection alive.
