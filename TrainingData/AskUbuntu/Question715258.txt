I have a dual boot Win7/Ubuntu laptop, HP ProBook 6460b.  When I installed Ubuntu, I set a separate partition for the /home folder and had some trouble setting it up to share with the windows partition.  In the end, I mounted the new partition at /home/storage/, and set my 'home' folder inside there.  This has given me a couple of fits, but has been nominally successful.</p>\n\n<p>I am having an issue with pulseaudio running, as it reports back that it does not have permissions to run in /home; this is true, because that is not where my home folder is located.  The result is that I have no means to adjust my audio; I can hear things like videos on firefox, but they come out weakly and from only the left front speaker.  </p>\n\n<p>I suspect that I need to modify the location of the pulseaudio conf file, but I'm not sure how to go about that.  I've been using ubuntu since 12.04, but mostly as a desktop user- if I type very many commands, they tend to be cut n pasted from instructions.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried a couple things from other threads, and they mostly ended in failures, and none of them ended in fixes.  Purging pulseaudio and reinstalling just removed all my system settings options, which forced me to reinstall ubuntu-desktop.  Force reloading alsa did not help.  I tried adding my user to the 'audio' group, but that didn't change. The last thing I did was install the upgraded hda intel packages from <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS</a> , also to little avail.  I hope someone can steer me in the right direction with this.

I'm trying to figure out how to get a similar setup to how I use these devices in windows (roughly).</p>\n\n<p>When I use MIXXX DJ software I'm able to select all the outputs of my M-Audio sound device by sending one deck to one set of outputs, and the other set to the other set of outputs so I can use my external mixer. This isn't the problem, but this illustrates my point later on. The point here, is that I'm able to use both outputs at the same time with this software.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after I sucessfully setup JackAudio and am using Ardour 3 for recording/producing I realized that JackAudio doesn't see all my inputs/outputs of my m-audio sound card. It only sees one set of input/outputs (one half of the card). and Pulse Audio is using the other set of outputs. \nSo, for instance if I have Ardour running on the first set of outputs, I can use Audacious and play mp3's which defaults to the other set of outputs (granted it locks up because jack locks the device up. The problem is that when I configure Jack Audio, I notice that only half of the outputs from my m-audio device show up in the control panel.</p>\n\n<p>At one point of time in the past I remember being able to use JackAudio to access both sets of in/outs on my m-audio card.</p>\n\n<p>I've also noticed that when I look up the ALSA panel, ALSA is using the set of outputs that JackAudio has access to, and Pulse Audio is using the other set. (granted in pulse audio my internal laptop audio is set to the default output).</p>\n\n<p>My suspicion is that Pulse Audio is grabbing the set of outputs that Jack Audio can utilize, and is blocking it from appearing in the Jack Audio Preferences. So I think that if I can find out how to get pulse audio to \"let go\" of the set of outputs that Jack Audio can't get, it'll work.</p>\n\n<p>so, as of now in my pulse audio control panel I have access to\n-Built-in Audio\n-HDMI Audio\n-M-AUDIO DFU RunTime (using channels 3/4 as outputs)</p>\n\n<p>ALSA has access to everything as well, however the outputs of the m-audio card are the 1/2 output.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be able to access simultaneously all the ins/outs of the m-audio card with Jack Audio so I can route to external analog mixer.</p>\n\n<p>So, how can I define with audio device is controlled by ALSA, Pulse Audio, and ultimately Jack Audio?</p>\n"},{"id":366977,"title":"lubuntu - audio drives not recognized","body":"<p>I typed <code>sudo dpkg -l | grep -e alsa -e pulseaudio</code> again, and got this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ii alsa-base 1.0.25+dfsg-0ubuntu4 all ALSA driver configuration files \nii alsa-utils 1.0.25-4ubuntu2 i386 Utilities for configuring and using ALSA \nii gnome-alsamixer 0.9.7~cvs.20060916.ds.1-3ubuntu1 i386 ALSA sound mixer for GNOME\nii gstreamer0.10-alsa:i386 0.10.36-1.1ubuntu1 i386 GStreamer plugin for ALSA \nii gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio:i386 0.10.31-3+nmu1ubuntu2 i386 GStreamer plugin for PulseAudio \nii pulseaudio 1:3.0-0ubuntu6 i386 PulseAudio sound server \nii pulseaudio-module-x11 1:3.0-0ubuntu6 i386 X11 module for PulseAudio sound server    \nii pulseaudio-utils 1:3.0-0ubuntu6 i386 Command line tools for the PulseAudio sound server\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After the commands in 2., pulseaudio is working again, but there is still no sound..
