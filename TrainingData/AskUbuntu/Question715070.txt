But then one day, steam decided to stop loading with the infamous error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now here's the case, I've spent like 6-8 hours trying to solve this, going to various forums looking for solutions, here's what I've done so far(at least that I can remember):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Deleting Nvidia driver and Steam in various orders through various methods, restarting computer like 20 times in doing that. (fail)</li>\n<li><p>Tried to figure out why it couldn't pick up libGL by trying to open that little gear spinning program, that should fail the same way steam does and show why it did, but it didn't fail and showed basically bugger all to me (fail)</p></li>\n<li><p>I've done all the system updating, everything I could imagine, still no results (fail)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Additional IMPORTANT (I guess) info: Now I've got them both installed and I've found that if I select Intel HD graphics card, I can load steam, but if I've Nvidia selected, no luck. Interesting thing to me is, that I can run other linux programs and even games (Like Doom 2 modifier Zandronum) it is just that Steam refuses to work, when Nvidia card is selected.</p>\n\n<p>Last bit: While providing help, keep in mind that I'm a complete novice at Ubuntu so try to keep it as simple as possible, also, I maybe could of done something wrong in the second method or misunderstood something, that's also a possibility, lastly, if I need to provide any other information, just ask nicely, I'll do it as fast as I can.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Don't hesitate to ask 'Have you tried doing X?'

So I'm having issues with World of Warcraft. After spending a lot of time a few months ago setting it up to install correctly, I had the game running perfect. All of the sudden, the game freezes up today and I had to restart the computer. When it came back, it said I had to reinstall the game because I was missing files. So I was annoyed, but whatever, I deleted everything (Threw out trash for space), and went to download the installer.</p>\n\n<p>When I pull up the installer it runs but the screen is cut off to where I cannot see anything other than the top left of the program. All I can see is the World of Warcraft logo and \"Battle.net\". Everything else is missing. </p>\n\n<p>I just don't understand because all of this was running perfectly fine an hour ago. I've tried restarting. I've tried changing from the NVIDEA driver to the Nouveau. I'm not sure what to do. I've scoured the internet for help, but nobody seems to have even posted this problem before. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the log from my command line when I run the installer.
