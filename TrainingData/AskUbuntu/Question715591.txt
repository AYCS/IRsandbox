The only issue I am having is that YouTube doesn't play above 360p. The options above it are not showing. It shouldn't be that the hardware is too slow as I have a Radeon R9 280x and an AMD FX8350. My internet connection is also plenty fast enough download being 100Mbps and upload being 20Mbps. The only thing that I could figure is that YouTube is using the HTML5 player which doesn't work with Firefox properly.</p>\n"},{"id":222057,"title":"Flickering on youtube","body":"<p>All the videos on youtube are flickering on my Ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>See screenshot: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/51dAk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/51dAk</a></p>\n\n<p>This happens with HTML5 enabled and disabled.</p>\n\n<p>I am running Ubuntu 12.10 on a Thinkpad X61s.</p>\n\n<p>This only happens on Google Chrome.</p>\n"},{"id":379794,"title":"YouTube Firefox app","body":"<p>Running a brand new installation of Ubuntu 13.04 I downloaded today and installed via a Live USB.\nFirst action was to open Firefox.

It looks like a lot of people have had troubles since that update (red videos, videos that just don't work) but I haven't found anybody with this kind of spectacular crash.
