The launcher starts correctly, and when I hit play the Mojang splash screen comes up.  Then when the game should launch, it looks like it's going full screen but only the title bar changes to say Minecraft 1.8.1.  The rest of the screen is still the Ubuntu desktop.  The music for the main menu does play, however.  This also causes the system to become unresponsive and I have to force shutdown.  After rebooting and trying a couple of times I can usually get to the main menu and once the game opens, I don't have any more problems.  Initially the game would freeze after about five minutes, but I fixed that by adding the swap file.  It still freezes on startup fairly regularly though. </p>\n"},{"id":573074,"title":"Install jstack without the entire openjdk-7-jdk bundle","body":"<p>I am wondering if it is possible to install jstack without the entire openjdk-7-jdk bundle.
