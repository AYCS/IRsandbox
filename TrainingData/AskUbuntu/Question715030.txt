Repeating the last steps of the procedure fixed that. </p>\n\n<p>Later on, I noticed that even after repeating the depmod modprobe and insmod commands as specified in the aforementioned procedure, it doesn't work, and I rather have to repeat most of the mentioned procedure once in a while for it to work.
