On clicking it, Ubuntu (10.04) asked to force-close which I did. What remains is a zombie process that uses 100% of 1 CPU, and that's pretty much stopping my little machine dead in its tracks. <code>top</code> and <em>System Monitor</em> look very much the same as the screenshots in <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/30891/is-there-any-way-to-kill-a-zombie-process-without-reboot\">this related question</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Steps taken:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I tried right-clicking the zombie in System Monitor and select \"Kill\" but nothing happened. </li>\n<li>Rebooting seems to work, except that it happens again when I restart Transmission. </li>\n<li>I see in System Monitor that it has a PID, 5 digits. I tried <code>sudo kill {the PID}</code> but nothing happened. (I don't know my way around Linux so I didn't try <code>kill</code> with any parameters.)</li>\n<li>Now, I'm simply not starting Transmission again until I know how to deal with this. </li>\n<li>I'm guessing that if I remove all Transmission downloads and reboot, then it would work again, perhaps until I try download some problematic file again?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong><br>\nIt's clear that I can't kill this zombie without rebooting. (Or can I?) How can I avoid this zombie? What is causing Transmission to break down?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Update 1:</strong> I now tried <code>sudo kill -9 {the PID}</code> and it didn't seem to do anything. A minute later the zombie was gone, and the grey Transmission window too. I started Transmission again, and it seems to run now. Very odd?</li>\n<li><strong>Update 2:</strong> I just waited a looong time, and it seems to have cleared itself up. Wondering if perhaps I was just being impatient, but I thought that an Intel i5 with 2GB RAM ought to be able to handle simple browsing plus Transmission. Should I just delete this question? It seems to have imploded.</li>\n<li><strong>Update 3:</strong> This seems to be unrelated to number of downloads (I had only one active), and to rate limits (it happened in both cases). But it's difficult to give useful updates, as it seems to be working fine now. I'll reboot and start Transmission again, then see if it misbehaves again.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":45881,"title":"Unable to kill process with &#39;kill -9&#39; whose PPID=1 and using 100% of CPU?","body":"<p><strong>Direct Question:</strong> Flash under firefox 4.0, npviewer.bin, in KUbuntu 10.04 was running at 100% and I couldn't kill it.
