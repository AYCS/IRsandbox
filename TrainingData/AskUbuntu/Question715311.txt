[{"id":715311,"title":"Network Manager keeps asking for username and password. Enterprise wifi and Ubuntu 15.10","body":"<p>So, as said in the title, the NM keeps asking me for my username and password, even though I have them entered correctly. Also, this is on a enterprise network, on Ubuntu 15.10. The radius server is a pfSense 2.2.6 box running FreeRadius, using it's own certs, but I have everything set in FreeRadius so that a cert is not needed. I have tried all 4 combinations of having an anonymous identity or not with AddTrust_External_Root or no cert required for those 2 fields. The other settings are:</p>\n\n<p>SSID: (Network)\nSecurity: WPA &amp; WPA2 Enterprise\nAuthentication: PEAP\nAnonymous Identity: (Tried my username and empty)\nCA Cert: (Tried AddTrust... and \"No CA...\")\nPEAP Version: Auto\nInner Authentication: MSCHAPv2\nUsername: (username)\nPassword: (a bunch of dots)</p>\n\n<p>(As a sidenote: I have connected successfully to my Uni's enterprise-level wifi, using an anonymous ID, and the AddTrust.., but I should also mention that we serve a user base of 40,000+ local users (on campus), and many more users from satellite campuses, therefore, there are authentic CA certs that the IT center uses.)</p>\n\n<p>I also have tried some other fixes, such as going into /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/(SSID), and adding the system-ca-certs=false, or whatever the other AskUbuntu answers suggested, and that did not work, even with a wifi and full computer restart.</p>\n\n<p>So, basically, I have no clue as to what there is that I can do. It seems that, from other similar questions, there is no fix, and Ubuntu has had this problem for a while. Please let me know if there is a fix for this that you can think of.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":715103,"title":"Wifi Network keeps dropping in Ubuntu 15.10","body":"<p>After upgrading my Dell Latitude Laptop to Ubuntu 15.10 , I am facing issues with the Wifi connection .
