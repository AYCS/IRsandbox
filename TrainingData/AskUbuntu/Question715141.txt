I have a second monitor connected to the computer as well via HDMI.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm observing is that when Xubuntu shuts down the monitor (not sleep, but more like screensaver?), Xubuntu thinks I disconnected it. This has a result that when I come back to the computer and the screensaver closes it is like I only have the secondary monitor connected. I have to manually reconfigure the monitors again in order for the 4K monitor to work. </p>\n\n<p>I already enabled \"automatically configure monitors when connected\" but that does not help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the comments there were suggestions that this question has a dupe. This is however not the case. Installing a screensaver that keeps my screen on is hardly a solution. </p>\n\n<p>After applying the solution given in the comments/answers I decided I should turn off my monitor at night because the lighting does not turn off. Doing this yields the same results as without the new screensaver: Ubuntu thinks it's gone and removes it. Each time I turn it on again I have to go through this procedure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have to manually add it via \"Display\" settings. </li>\n<li>Click on \"Use this display\". </li>\n<li>Apply the settings.</li>\n<li>AT this point both monitors are on top of eachother</li>\n<li>Drag the right full hd monitor to the correct position</li>\n<li>Apply again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The odd thing is that this is only the case for the 4K monitor. The secondary full hd monitor (connected via DVI) does not show this behaviour. I have had multi-monitor setup for a few years now.

I also have disk encryption enabled, and I'm using classic GNOME instead of Unity.</p>\n\n<p>This all started with a different problem, actually: when I rebooted the system, the BIOS would load, the purple background of what I assume was GRUB appeared for a few seconds, and then both screens would go into power save.</p>\n\n<p>At first, I got around this by simply hard-rebooting when it got \"stuck,\" and everything was fine. Today, I tried hitting some random keys, and surprisingly, the disk encryption screen came up. When I logged in, however, one of my monitors (the DVI) worked fine, but the other (the VGA) looked like this. (By the way, I'm using TwinView or whatever the equivalent is; that is, I'm not mirroring monitors.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QqWcMgm.jpg\" alt=\"photo of monitor\"></p>\n\n<p>The picture isn't good, but basically it's a solid color similar to whatever color the desktop background is, with lots of slightly darker vertical lines. Changing the desktop background changes this solid color. If I change to \"mirror screens,\" this monitor displays a solid gray color.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, after one reboot, I also had to deal with a different problem where I couldn't log in through X (due to ~/.Xauthority changing owners). While I was trying to fix that, I rebooted a couple times and messed a bit with my ~/.config/ (deleted monitors.xml) and /etc/X11/Xorg.conf (tried to generate a new one), and had some even weirder things happen, e.g. mirrored screens where one was <em>translated</em> about a quarter-screen to the left, and then wrapped. </p>\n\n<p>But now that part's fixed, and I'm still left with one working monitor and one solid-color monitor.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, it might be easiest to just do a fresh install, but I'm worried the same thing might just happen again (maybe it's a hardware thing?)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: some more info--if I change to lower resolutions, that monitor starts flashing madly...</p>\n"},{"id":164803,"title":"Dual Monitors Won&#39;t Work","body":"<p>I am running version 12.04 LTS with the additional driver installed for my graphics card; HIS Radeon HD 5450 Silence 1GB DDR3 HDMI HDCP.</p>\n\n<p>I have an LG (don't know model) and a Dell (also no model) attached to the DVI and VGA ports on the card, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>When I go to \"Displays\" and turn on the Dell monitor, it's just blank.

AMD CCC gives me an error saying it doesn't know why but it can't be enabled, and something about possible not enough video memory (though its a 1gb card).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if there is some kind of tweak I can perform to get the third monitor working again?
