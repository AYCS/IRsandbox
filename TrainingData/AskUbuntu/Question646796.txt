The fact that Widows was on a different HD made it easy to ensure that I did not disrupt the Windows partition (the windows partions were \"ATA\" and the ext HD were \"USB\".  THAT was probably KEY to the success.  <strong>15.04 on the external HD worked well multiple times, both on the T520i and on an HP Pavillion E017DX</strong> when booting from the external HD (Mitsunishi DM256 1TB).  I used the F12 key on bootup on the T520i to select the bootup device.</p>\n\n<p>On both computers, Unbuntu recognized both the 497 and 494 GB partions as drives and Unbuntu worked apparently well,  as did Windows on both when not selecting Unbuntu on startup (or just without the ext HD attached).   One ext HD with Unbuntu 15.04 that could boot on multiple computers.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't know when to let well enough alone, and <strong>decided to install 15.04 on the T520i as a dual boot.</strong>    The installation software did not give the labels given the partitions in windows and the names it gave them were not readily distinguishable as to which one was the Windows boot partition.   THAT IMHO is a HUGE problem with the installation software.  (all you techies, please note that something in the name than clearly indicates TO YOU which partition is the windows boot may be totally obscure to a user with lower skill levels.[[PS  some Windows systems CUSTOMIZED by the OEM (and it appears Lenovo did that with the T520's) may give a different numbering system to the partitions AND THE BOOT PARTITION MAY BE A DIFFERENT NUMBER THAN IT USUALLY IS)     It there is some element in the name that identifies the windows boot partition the installation software should AUTOMATICALLY prevent it being changed UNLESS the user specifically indicates that keeping Windows is not intended!</p>\n\n<p>****My T520i now not only cannot find windows, it cannot even find the hard drive it was on!****</p>\n\n<p>I reformatted the Ext HD in one 1 TB partition (using the Pavillion (Windows 8.1) which may have been the root cause of errors).    I then installed 15.04 on the ext HD again.  </p>\n\n<p>Could 15.04 have formatted the entire internal HD of the T520i in EUFI format instead of the NFS it was before and that's why the computer can't find it?  (I may try physically removing the HD and attaching it to the HP pavillion to see if it is then recognized)</p>\n\n<p>The Windows 7 Pro 64 bit has a COA but MSFT requires the installation disks to be obtained from the OEM (Lenovo) (I presume because Lenovo did some customizations that required alterations or additions to Windows).   I bought the T520i used (for the express purpose of running Ubuntu without having to risk my working computer,  GOOD THING I DID!, because of all the prior problems posted about Ubuntu installations going very bad.    I'm having to go thru the proof of ownership hoops (despite having a legal Microsoft Certificate of Authenticity for the Windows 7 Pro 64 bit!) in an attempt to get installation disks with the computer (bought used on Ebay).</p>\n\n<p>THE BIG QUESTION:   when installing 15.04 on the same HD as another operating system (especially Windows), how do you ensure that the installation does not destroy a partition vital to Windows?     </p>\n\n<p>Why can't the 15.04 installation automatically block that unless the use selects an UNAMBIGUOUS option to REPLACE Windows (WITH A CONFIRMATION REQUIRED!)??</p>\n\n<p>If the Ubuntu installation software is as dangerous to use as it appears to be, the risks should be made very clear for the sake of less advanced users.</p>\n\n<p>Had I not had the foresight to use a SPARE computer to try the installation, I would have been in a very serious situation indeed.   Some of us don't have enough spare money to just go out and buy a new computer on short notice.</p>\n"},{"id":496751,"title":"Ubuntu 14.04 installer doesn&#39;t detect my partitions","body":"<p>I'm running Win7 64-bit and I'm trying to dual-boot Ubuntu 14.04.\nHowever, when I go into the Ubuntu installer, it doesn't display any of my partitions.\nI would like to mention that this is my second installation of Win7 on my laptop.
