It supports excellent column-mode editing and works on all three major OS platforms without any issue.  Highly recommended!</p>\n"},{"id":516115,"title":"Text editor that updates file without prompting","body":"<p>Is there any console- or window-based text editor that automatically reloads file changed on disk without prompting anything?</p>\n"},{"id":427397,"title":"What text editor will not overload my Xubuntu 13.10?","body":"<p>I don't do a lot of it, but I need to edit some html files and need a text editor to do it.

I need to edit a .tex file this way, can be with Sublime, Gedit, Geany, Kile, etc. I prefer Gedit, Geany or Kile although any plain text editor that has this feature will be welcome.
