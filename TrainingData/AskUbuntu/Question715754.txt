I have no idea why, but my Ubuntu installation was bound to update center in my country (it is Georgia, small but lovely place) and as I get this \"update center\" was not holding all the updates, or may be it was holding only important ones. I am not sure if this was a correct term for that. So I had trouble with all those \"sudo apt-get\" commands all the time.</p>\n\n<p>And here comes the AMBLE - Couple of days ago I encountered the article of updating Ubuntu version, which was no more than running \"update-manager\" and switching to US update center and getting all those updates, <strong>including</strong> Ubuntu 14.10</p>\n\n<p>So I did all those updates, I am not sure if I got 14.10 version, as when logging to system the background wallpaper still said it was 14.04, so assume that I did no upgrade to 14.10. And then I ran 15.04 upgrade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Fact 01</strong> : After spending several hours of trying to get to system I already know that it was bad idea to upgrade 14.04 to 15.04.</p>\n\n<p>During the upgrade to 15.04 my system just stuck at starting MySql service, as many others did. I have waited for couple of hours and then I just shutdown the machine as I had no other idea what to do with it.</p>\n\n<p>As you may already guess I can not get the system alive anymore. The system boots up well, but when entering the password it displays some console text screen for a short time and gets me back to login screen again. Unfortunately it is too fast to get any information out of it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I have tried so far</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Try to load the older versions - Restart, hit \"Shift\", select \"Advanced Options\" select other boot options - same effect in any of them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Get to Grub configuration screen, unfortunately I have no idea what to do there.</p></li>\n<li><p>Get to console screen out of boot options menu - same effect.</p></li>\n<li><p>I'have found USB Bootable drive from which I've installed 14.04, I tried to run boot-repair (<a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair</a>) tool from it, no effect (paste.ubuntu link - <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/13295677/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/13295677/</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>Right now I try to do some silly things, but that's all I can do, unless someone with better knowledge of the system can help me - I ran 'update-manager' out of 'Try Ubuntu\" system loaded from flash drive, just hoping to the best - that it does some changes to existing system on my hard drive.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I do not need to save any data from my laptop, I just do not want to reinstall it, I really want to make it work.

It says \"Inspiron 15, 5000 series\" on some kind of sticker on the left below the keyboard.</p>\n\n<p>So, as an improvement to their previous models, Dell has added a keyboard combination to switch off the wifi (who has ever asked for that?). By default, the wifi is switched off (Duh). You have to press that keyboard combination first, before wifi will be activated. Unlike what they may think, what they came up with is not a feature. It is a bug.</p>\n\n<p>From there, wifi will only work for some wifi networks. Everybody else will be able to connect on the fly, while everybody using the Dell/Ubuntu combinations will be out of luck. It is difficult to say why exactly Dell/Ubuntu wifi works with some networks and not with others; but nobody else besides Dell/Ubuntu users seems to be complaining.</p>\n\n<p>If I disable and re-enable the wifi in the unnamed program in the top menu bar, the wifi networks will disappear, never to reappear again. Gone. Bye bye. That is another bug.</p>\n\n<p>Every year the combo Dell/Ubuntu seems to be getting worse and worse. The accumulation of bad ideas just does not seem to stop!

Yesterday, I wanted to watch a film using VLC Media Player. The trouble was, my version of VLC did not open files with hevc/x265 codec, so I wanted to upgrade this to version 2.2 or higher. Unlucky, it was impossible both via terminal and Software Center. There was trouble with some dependencies. So I removed VLC completely and I wanted to reinstall, but it proved impossible to do, from the same reason. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to upgrade my Ubuntu to version 14.10. I did it via Update Manager. There were more problems. Updating process didn't go correctly. Some errors were shown, something wasn't installed etc. But upgrading was finished and only thing left was to reboot computer. So I did. Then occur the real trouble. </p>\n\n<p>After rebooting it was impossible to log in. There was a communicate, that only possible is working in low graphic mode. The only thing I could do was log in via terminal and typing commands. So I decided to looking for some solutions in Internet using LiveCD Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (the only version I've got). I've got two ideas what to do next - fix booting options or upgrade to Ubuntu 15.04. </p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This command did not help at all. When I typed others, like</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it was too helpful also. The light of hope was when I use those commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo aptitude remove fglrx\nsudo aptitude install fglrx\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it was deceptive. I still can no longer log into my system, but at least there was initial checking disks for errors (like sometimes before log in). But it let me type in terminal commands to upgrade Ubuntu so I did it. </p>\n\n<p>I'm afraid it was definitely end. Though the downloading of necessary files went so good, there were still problem with installation. The communicate said something, that it was impossible to upgrade because of <strong>too many errors</strong>. When I reboot computer, I can not even get to terminal mode in low graphic mode. It shows only this window with inscription \"Ubuntu\" and those little white points below (normally, while loading, they turn red). </p>\n\n<p>All right, it was long introduction. </p>\n\n<p>Using LiveCD i peeked, that in partition, the version of Ubuntu installed in partition is updated to 15.04. So I downloaded ISO file with 15.04 version and tried to reinstall system. I know there is such possibility - in <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/196740/how-to-fix-an-ubuntu-system-when-it-wont-boot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link</a> someone shows screen which proves that I can reinstall existing version of Ununtu on my computer without losing data nor programs. But when I try to do it, the only options I've got are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Install Ubuntu alongside them</li>\n<li>Erase disc and install Ubuntu</li>\n<li>Something else</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not a slide of possibility of reinstall. </p>\n\n<p>But what is more, I've chosen first option to install this version in some little space of disc, it worked, worked, then it informed me that Ubuntu 15.04 was installed and all I need to reboot computer... After reboot there is nowhere to choose supposedly instaled version! Grub is like it was before. </p>\n\n<p>Please advise me what should I do next.
