Unfortunately, the machine contains GBs worth of data that I must backup to the office's shared network drive before I can reinstall Windows 7 a fresh again. Therefore, I decided to use Ubuntu live CD and run it through the \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" option to connect to the office's wireless LAN and then copy all the relevant folders that contain important data to the network drive.\nI could easily track down the folders/files that I needed from the Windows source directory by starting from Ubuntu's Devices section then navigating through this location: /media/Windows7_OS (I assumed this is how Ubuntu sees the drive C labeled with the same name).\nAnd then, I could just as easily find my network destination after successfully connecting to the wireless LAN and finding it under Ubuntu's Network section by navigating through this location: Browse Network > Then opening the drive > NAS-KKM(FTP) (I picked FTP since I figured file transfer was my objective).\nAfter successfully logging into the file server, I simply tried copying and pasting my directories of interest from the source, to the destination - though unfortunately, I kept getting this error message almost immediately:</p>\n\n<p>Error while copying \".docx\".</p>\n\n<p>There was an error copying the file into <a href=\"ftp://nas-kkm.local/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ftp://nas-kkm.local/</a>...</p>\n\n<p>Error reading from file: Permission denied</p>\n\n<p>So I tried finding an alternate way to my backing up problem, and I found a post that recommended I try using \"sudo cp\" to copy my files through the terminal. However, I still cannot copy my files. I used this command:</p>\n\n<p>sudo cp /media/Windows7_OS/Users/Profile One/Desktop <a href=\"ftp://nas-kkm.local/MyOffice/T430_Laptop/Profile%One/Desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">ftp://nas-kkm.local/MyOffice/T430_Laptop/Profile%One/Desktop</a></p>\n\n<p>Notice I placed \"%\" in place of a space in one of the destination sub-directories since it seemed as though the command didn't want any spaces in my directories for the destination.\nUnfortunately, this still didn't work. (As you can see, I'm trying to back up the entire desktop from the user \"Profile One\".)</p>\n\n<p>The command cannot find my destination directory - even when I tried renaming it without spaces.</p>\n\n<p>As I'd mentioned earlier, I've never used the terminal to run any commands before - this is my first time and I'm  only familiar with the Ubuntu GUI interface since it's intuitive to use.</p>\n\n<p>Any assistance will greatly be appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Kind regards,\nRama</p>\n"},{"id":459810,"title":"Best backup software for ubuntu","body":"<p>I need a backup software for Ubuntu 14.04 that has a GUI that can backup my entire system to an external hard drive or network drive.
