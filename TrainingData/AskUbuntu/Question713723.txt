Not sure what controller the Marvel M70 uses, but I think it might be Phison)</p>\n\n<p>I've gotten consistently 45 MB / sec read speed with the Corsair Survivor Stealth when it was recognizing as <strong>high-speed</strong> NOT <strong>SuperSpeed</strong>.  (Windows 7 shows 200 MB/sec read and 147 MB / sec  write for the Corsair). </p>\n\n<p><strong>After installing libccid :</strong></p>\n\n<p>After running:  <strong>sudo apt-get install libccid</strong>  and rebooting, I was able to get about 200 MB / sec READ on both drives.  <strong>However, the WRITE speed is horrible...  around 15 MB/sec</strong> for the Corsair Survivor Stealth  and <strong>around 5 MB/sec</strong> for the Silicon Power Marvel M70.</p>\n\n<p>Side Note: a Transcend JetFlash 790 worked fine with a fresh install with expected USB 3.0 speeds and proper recognition of \"SuperSpeed\" unlike the other devices until I installed \"libccid\"  (both read and write were fine with the Transcend prior to installing libccid).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, I'm not entirely sure why I needed libccid as it seemed to have something to do with smart card readers etc... but, I tried it anyway and seemed to finally get \"SuperSpeed\" to show up for the Survivor Stealth and Marvel M70.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, is there another way to get this thing working with USB 3.0 speeds for <strong>both read and write</strong>  And is \"libccid\" potentially considered a bad idea for some reason;  i.e. I'd rather not have data corruption and deal with USB 2.0 speeds if it really must come to that... ?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  After many subsequent tests,  I'm starting to think it was merely coincidental that suddenly the USB 3.0 \"SuperSpeed\" recognition in /var/log/syslog right after I installed \"libccid\".     My proof is I did a full fresh installation and did not install libccid;  after about 20 USB drive connections it finally reported SuperSpeed (and gave very fast READ speed, but slow WRITE speeds as metioned above) ...  but again,  I did not install libccid to achieve this.</p>\n\n<p>I'm still trying to figure out how to reliably get these drives to reliably connect at USB 3.0 and give expected read and write performance speeds.</p>\n"},{"id":603387,"title":"Same USB Port, Same Device: Sometimes Superspeed (USB 3.0) and Sometimes high-speed (USB 2.0)","body":"<p>OS: Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS  updated to Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS</p>\n\n<p>Plugging USB flash drive directly into the notebook computer (USB 3.0 port; not using HUB;   ALL USB 3.0 external hard drives always connect at SuperSpeed).</p>\n\n<p>Trying with two USB 3.0 ports (both are USB 3.0) and work fine in Windows as well as Linux (with external USB 3.0 HDDs).</p>\n\n<p>Ports are completely clean and free of dust as are the brand new USB 3.0 flash drives.</p>\n\n<p>Upon plugging a USB 3.0 Flash drive sometimes /var/log/syslog reports:</p>\n\n<p><strong>new high-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd</strong></p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p><strong>new SuperSpeed USB device number 7 using xhci_hcd</strong></p>\n\n<p>I get the same results with both ports... however, sometimes I get a lot of \"Superspeed\" connections in a row,  or \"high-speed\" connections in a row.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to get it to connect at SuperSpeed, sometimes I have to switch ports (there are two) and upon going back to the opposite port it will correctly recognize as SuperSpeed.
