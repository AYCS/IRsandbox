It's a bit of a kludge, but it works. It's Python with wxPython... it uses rhythmbox-client to get the track info, and then displays it in a small window. I'd github it, but it's still pretty sloppy. Works for me, but I'd be ashamed to put the code out into the world in its present state. If anyone else would find this useful, let me know and I'll clean it up a bit and post it.</p>\n"},{"id":284732,"title":"Rhythmbox keeps repeating same song after play queue is empty","body":"<p>I'm not sure if this is a bug, but whenever Rhythmbox is finished playing all the songs in my play queue it immediately jumps to first song in my music library and keeps playing it over and over.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have shuffle or repeat enabled.</p>\n\n<p>Its just plain weird.

Since my most recent upgrade, I can only look at the properties (no editing).

So, when I want to play one particular song on loop it doesn't work. It goes through every song I ever played one at a time and then loops. I tried creating a new play list with one song but I have no idea how to add a song to a playlist. When I go to Edit -> \"Add to Playlist\" and click on the playlist I created, nothing happens. When I go to music -> import file and click on a song nothing happens.
