First off, the machine is an HP Pavilion x360 laptop/tablet initially coming with Windows 8.1.  I initially installed ubuntu (I think 14.04?), and the system could dual boot either windows or ubuntu fine.  Then, an hp technician updated the bios for my system, which caused the system to automatically boot to windows.</p>\n\n<p>When I go to the startup menu and try to boot ubuntu from grub (purple screen with 4 options, Ubuntu, advanced options for Ubuntu, Windows, system setup), it goes straight to a blank purple screen.  From there I need to shut down the system manually (hold power button).  When I reboot under advanced options and select <strong>Ubuntu, with Linux 4.2.0-18-generic (recovery mode)</strong>, it does the same thing after printing the line <strong>Initializing ramdisk</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>To troubleshoot, I did a system restore on the laptop, resetting everything to factory settings (however, I can still choose to boot into ubuntu which confuses me because grub still exists).  Then I did a fresh install of ubuntu 14.04 on a usb stick.  I tried both install ubuntu and try ubuntu from the usb stick, both of which cause the same blank purple screen (also verified the iso checksums).  I then installed a fresh copy of ubuntu 15.10 and tried the same thing to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>After this, I tried the debugging tips from</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/162075/my-computer-boots-to-a-black-screen-what-options-do-i-have-to-fix-it/162087#162087\">My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it?</a></p>\n\n<p>After installing boot-repair to a usb stick, I tried to boot from the usb drive, still getting a blank screen (this time black with a cursor).  When I ran failsafe mode, this was the output:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/cPF1j.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">boot-repair black screen: failsafe mode output</a></p>\n\n<p>From here, I started troubleshooting grub.  I tried putting in 'nomodeset' at the end of the linux line, as well as replacing \"quiet splash\" with \"nomodeset\".  Both still cause the blank purple screen.</p>\n\n<p>I also looked at this article:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze</a></p>\n\n<p>After trying to connect to the frozen machine with ssh over ethernet, it says the connection was refused.  I don't know how to setup an ssh server if I can't boot into the system.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this was helpful and not just your typical blank screen post.  I'm new to ubuntu so it's difficult to diagnose the problem.  Let me know if you need any more info about the machine/boot screens, etc.  Thanks!</p>\n"},{"id":193896,"title":"Can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs)","body":"<p>I downloaded 12.04.1 and md5 sum checked them and everything is good. </p>\n\n<p>Made a live usb and booted up...</p>\n\n<p>Just gets to where its about to start with the purple ubuntu loading screen then it goes back to text and gives this message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>BusyBox v1.18.5 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.5-1ubuntu4) built-in shell (ash) Enter\n  'help' for a list of built-in commands.</p>\n  \n  <p>(initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on ///filesystem.squashfs\n  failed: Input/output error Can not mount /dev/loop0\n  (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This happens in the live option, or persistent even the file checking one doesn't work</p>\n\n<p>Also I've tried a few different <kbd>F6</kbd> options to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>I used 'LiLi USB creator' and 'unetbootin' and also 'Universal USB Installer,' all with the same results.
