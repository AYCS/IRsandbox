What I always come back to is a dpkg error that looks like this:</p>\n\n<p>dpkg: error processing package ttf-mscorefonts-installer (--configure):\n package ttf-mscorefonts-installer is not ready for configuration\n cannot configure (current status 'half-installed')</p>\n\n<p>After trying the various apt-get clean, update, and remove options I finally get the message that:</p>\n\n<p>Testo@Testbox01:~$ apt-get remove ttf-mscorefonts-install\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?</p>\n\n<p>So now the database is locked up and I'll have to reboot - again - to unlock it.</p>\n\n<p>So here is my question - how can I manually rip out ttf-mscorefonts-install and its dependencies by the roots so that they no longer infect the rest of the installed products database?
