Think several years before Ipods. I never really had the need to burn too many cds. My girlfriend, however, keeps asking for cds for her cars cd player. I do have a huge collection. Most of which from artists who have a live recording policy. So sorry, no help on illegal downloads from me. So, can I give her great quality music, or will I need to convert these to mp3s? If this is the latter, what format might one suggest? Google seems to indicate that it is indeed possible. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I burn these files from the command line?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am probably going to burn straight from my file-sever, which is headless machine (10.4)? I do have some .cue files, but ironically they seem to point to .wav files, where the files in question are .flac files. Am I able to utilize these .cue files? </p>\n"},{"id":603714,"title":"How to burn an audio master cd?","body":"<p><strong>What I do:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I record and mix audio using <a href=\"https://ardour.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ardour</a> or <a href=\"http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/mixbus.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harrison Mixbus</a>.
