I'd like to be able to use that ATI card for high performance graphics on my laptop in Ubuntu but when I try to use the fglrx drivers, it still says that only the Intel card is being used. I installed AMD's ATI Radeon HD 63xx series drivers but that led to Ubuntu booting and going attempting to go into \"Low graphics mode\" which ended up just freezing on the \"low graphics mode\" selection screen, so I went into ctrl+alt+f1 console and reinstalled the fglrx driver so I could reboot into Linux.
