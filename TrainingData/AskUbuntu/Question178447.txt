The processor is a brand new Intel Atom D525 (computer is brand new). It is a regular full install (so I am not trying to create a live USB) using the regular desktop installer run from another USB pendrive (to be called the live USB) which runs the Desktop 12.04 ISO. I want to use this install USB as a default for booting, no other drives are connected.</p>\n\n<p>I followed all steps from: <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/89241/how-can-i-run-ubuntu-without-a-hard-drive\">How can I run Ubuntu without a hard drive?</a> and from Method 1 of: <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent/</a>. So basically I created a new MBR on the USB pendrive with two partitions (EXT2 mounted on / and 2GB swap). I have installed the bootloader (GRUB) on the /dev/sda (I actually also tried /dev/sda1 just to see whether that would work...) which is the install USB (the live USB is /dev/sdb). Everything seemed to work perfectly fine (live USB boots/works perfectly).</p>\n\n<p>However, when booting from the install USB I am confronted with the GRUB prompt instead of a menu or Ubuntu booting. No message whatsoever, just the prompt. This happens everytime I try to install. Entering commands in the GRUB prompt such as \"ls\" all end in an error: \"hd0 read error\" or \"no such partition\".</p>\n\n<p>I have already tried these options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Install on /dev/sda1 instead of /dev/sda (obviously does not work, had to try)</li>\n<li>Install using EXT4 instead of EXT2 (same result, as expected)</li>\n<li>Reinstall GRUB using Boot-repair (same result)</li>\n<li>Reinstall GRUB from commandline (same result)</li>\n<li>Two complete reinstalls using a brand new Ubuntu Desktop ISO and different tools to create the live USB pendrive (hash checked) (takes ~2 hours per install including updates...)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My guts tell me that somehow GRUB2 is incompatible with reading from the pendrive (again, live USB boots fine, but I think that uses a different bootloader).</p>\n\n<p>I would like to use the install USB as a default boot drive (as the computer is going to be online 24/7 so a slow boot is not a problem and it should work...). I hope my problem is clear and that someone could help me out. I already tried Googling and asking for help on the IRC channel, but no result (the guy did not know what was going on either and suggesting posting here). I would very much appreciate any help as I am basically out of options.</p>\n"},{"id":137204,"title":"Ubuntu 12.04 installed on hard disk using USB pendrive does not boot from hard disk","body":"<p>I installed Ubuntu 12.04 using USB pendirve but it only boots if that USB is connected.
