After some digging, I came across the solution presented <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/186847/error-gnutls-handshake-falied-when-connecting-to-https-servers\">here</a>, which essentially advised me to compile git against OpenSSL instead of GNUTLS.  I did so, and all was right with the world.</p>\n\n<p>I have just encountered the same error again. I went back to check my control file, and GNUTLS is nowhere to be found (I had replaced such instances with OpenSSL as prescribed).  Can anyone advise me on where to look for the call that still seeks to use GNUTLS instead of OpenSSL? Is something else going on here?</p>\n\n<p>I should also note that while inspecting my OpenSSL install, I received a warning suggesting that my config file could not be opened.  This is presumably because the path cited does not exist.  I have never called OpenSSL directly before (as may be obvious, I am quite ignorant in this area), so I cannot speak to whether or not this issue correlates with the GNUTLS business.  If you think it is related, and/or just feel like sharing which environmental variable (I presume) must be modified so that OpenSSL can find the config file, please enlighten me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This appears to be a Github related issue, insofar as I was able to commit just fine. The log files serve as evidence of that, and there was no error. This fits with my intuition since the commit is local and would therefore have no need to deal with the capabilities of GNUTLS and OpenSSL to the best of my knowledge.  Nevertheless, feel free to adjust my worldview.</p>\n"},{"id":447044,"title":"Graphical GitHub client for ubuntu?","body":"<p>I am looking for an easy to use, graphical github client for ubuntu, since I do not know how to use git in the terminal (yet).\nThanks</p>\n"},{"id":237342,"title":"How to set up Launchpad to import from GitHub?","body":"<p>I'm setting up my first Launchpad project.</p>\n\n<p>In this case I would like to import from the Master branch from my <a href=\"https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser\">GitHub project</a> - the default branch is not Master - it is a release branch currently called \"Release-0.6\"</p>\n\n<p>On Launchpad I have set up to automatically import:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/BGM1w.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the import failed - the error log states:</p>\n\n<pre>\n2013-01-07 14:45:11 INFO    Starting job.\n2013-01-07 14:45:11 INFO    Getting exising bzr branch from central store.\n2013-01-07 14:45:14 INFO    [chan bzr SocketAsChannelAdapter] Opened sftp connection (server version 3)\n2013-01-07 14:45:17 INFO    [chan bzr SocketAsChannelAdapter] Opened sftp connection (server version 3)\n2013-01-07 14:45:17 INFO    291 bytes transferred\n2013-01-07 14:45:18 INFO    No branch found at remote location.\n</pre>\n\n<p>This is strange since my GitHub project is obviously at the correct web-location.</p>\n\n<p>Thus - what have I done wrong in my configuration?</p>\n\n<p>i.e. how should I have set up my Launchpad project to import from Github?</p>\n"},{"id":343395,"title":"How do I prevent git from requiring sudo on every git command","body":"<p>I created a directory <code>/var/www</code> to store my web apps clone in.
