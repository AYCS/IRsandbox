I know how to get the .iso, but instructions for how to 'convert' it to .img I only found under Mac (see, for example, <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/307360/how-to-convert-from-iso-to-img-file\">here</a>) -- however, I work on Ubuntu 13.10. Which are the steps necessary to create the .img file? </p>\n\n<p>Background information: I would like to use the .img to run it with Complete Linux Installer on Android. Complete Linux Installer already offers .img files (see <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxonandroid/files/Ubuntu/13.10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), but they are too small. Ubuntu only \"sees\" the size of the .img file which is far too small to be productive -- which is why I would like to create a larger .img file. Using <code>resize2fs myImage.img 4G</code>, I tried to make the image larger, but Ubuntu run from such an image still believes the .img is small, so my hope is that by creating a larger .img right away, Ubuntu \"sees\" the larger space.

I recently decided to install ubuntu on it as the sole OS as it was running 10.4.11 and was unable to meet my current needs.  The optical drive on it is broken,  so I downloaded the ubuntu iso,  converted it to a DMG and created a bootable flash drive.  Everything seemed to be going great.  I used gparted to wipe the hard drive and than began running the installer from the live enviro.   That's when things took a turn for the worst..  Half way through the installer crashed.  I attempted it a few more times,  but it eventually just froze solid.  I asked around what to do and was told to just reboot and try again.  Now it is not seeing the flash drive, and there is no OS to boot to,  so I'm just getting the ol' grey screen with a flashing question mark..  </p>\n\n<p>I bought a new 500gig external that I can format for a mac..

The curve ball is that I don't have another PC to make the DVD on, so I'm using my Mac (running OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard).</p>\n\n<p>I downloaded the proper ISO file to my Mac (32-bit, ubuntu-12.04.3-server-i386.iso) and checked the md5 hash with the published one on ubuntu.com.

The disk verifies fine. </p>\n\n<p>One odd thing to note: If I try to \"Open\" the downloaded .iso volume with the Mac disk utility, it says, \"No mountable file systems.\" Likewise, if I try to mount the newly burned DVD, it won't work for the same reason. However, I can \"Convert\" the iso file using the Disk Utility, which blows it out into a directory with files you'd expect to see on a boot disk. More on this Converted directory later.</p>\n\n<p>I take the newly burned and verified ISO DVD to the PC and try to boot from it. The DVD reader, BTW, is the topmost device in the boot list.</p>\n\n<p>The reader spends a while reading the DVD (the light comes on and it spins up) but then the BIOS simply prints out: \"Missing Operating System\".</p>\n\n<p>Now, to eliminate the possibility of a bad DVD reader, we took an old (2002) Red Hat Linux boot CD we had and tried that. It was recognized immediately and the Linux install program started up. However, that doesn't appear to be an ISO image, because if I put that in my Mac, it mounts immediately and I see the boot files, etc. And yes, the drive in the PC is a DVD reader, not a CD reader.</p>\n\n<p>So, I thought perhaps the aged PC's BIOS might not like ISO files, so I took the \"Converted\" directory files (recall those from above?) and burned them to a DVD and tried to boot from that. Still the same \"Missing Operating System\" message.</p>\n"},{"id":473766,"title":"Burning iso to usb in ubuntu on mac hardware","body":"<p>I am trying to \"burn\" (yes I know thats not the right term) an iso for xubuntu onto my usb pendrive.
