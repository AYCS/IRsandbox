[{"id":387241,"title":"Can I recover a former version of a libreoffice document?","body":"<p>I've searched high and low for an answer to this and haven't been able to find one, so hopefully someone here can help. </p>\n\n<p>I was working on an essay and had made substantial progress but had to take a break, so I saved it, closed Libreoffice Writer and walked away.  When I came back to start work again and opened Libreoffice Writer, it said that the document hadn't been saved and offered me a chance to recover it, which naturally and unthinkingly I took.  However, the document it so helpfully restored (and also overwrote my newer version with) was in fact a previous version, so at the moment it looks like I've lost several days' worth of work.  </p>\n\n<p>I've checked Ubuntu One, but it only has the updated version.

What should I do? I need this font...</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDITED:</strong> So I turned off this blockage on firefox and I can download file and open it, haven't tried to open it in MS office yet, so not sure if it will work if something really wrong what libre does with MS fonts...</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> well... everything works in MS Office, nothing bad happened with fonts or document when I opened it. So everything works, but still, browser treats it as virus or spyware. :) I guess LibreOffice guys should know that...</p>\n"},{"id":573231,"title":"Recovering a password protected LibreOffice Writer document","body":"<p>A year ago I started a memoir and wrote 120000 words, which I password protected in LibreOffice 3 writer.
