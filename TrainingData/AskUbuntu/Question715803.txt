I'm not using it that much but I really want to try some Linux distros on it. My laptop didn't come wih any Windows installed but FreeDOS.</p>\n\n<p>First I had Windows XP on it and when 7 was released, I installed it and it's there since then. However, some time after I decided to install openSUSE or Ubuntu on it and run into some weird problems. </p>\n\n<p>Whenever I insert a DVD or USB drive with a Linux distro, the laptop hangs and the caps lock led blinks 5 times. I searched a bit on HP support and this seems to be the general board failure code. I am however a bit skeptical about this since I am able to boot up any Windows version and any rescue CD/USB drive that's based on Linux/Knoppix. I cannot however boot up Knoppix itself, unselI use an YUMI USB drive. But this only works with Knoppix and from time to time with some Ubuntu distros.</p>\n\n<p>First thing I did when I noticed the problem was to contact HP support. I never got an answer on the support forum or to my emails so I decided to call them, especially since my laptop was still under warranty. Unfortunately, it seams that HP doesn't give a damn on their clients and every time I called them I got the same answer: \"We only manage requests from business users, no matter what your warranty card says\" :| In the end they told me to stop calling because I'm annoying. I also got the same response from the retailer store I got the laptop from (authorized HP store/repair center), after I described the issue. Needless to say HP won't ever see my money again.</p>\n\n<p>This being said, after trying for years to find a solution for this, I somehow managed to boot up Ubuntu 13.04 and to install it. But since that day, I was unable to boot up any other non-live installable Linux distro, not even with YUMI.</p>\n\n<p>And now I am trying to install another Linux distro and I can't get it to work anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>PS: The reason I'm using the minimal ISO instead of just a regular ubuntu ISO is because the CD drive on my laptop is pretty crappy and sometimes stops reading in the middle of an installation.
