It is very slow and I do not know the purpose of it. One idea that comes to my head is that my laptop is quite old, but I can recall that a year ago the situation was not so desperate. Yesterday I installed a fresh operating system Ubuntu with that hope that it will fix things and indeed it has but not that much in order to be satisfying. The only games I play are the ones that I am trying to create. When I use Chrome my the speed of my laptop drops dramatically. I tried switching to Firefox but that did not fix the problem either. Eclipse is taking too much time to load and when my code gets bigger the letters that I type appear with a delay of 500-700 milliseconds which is really annoying. </p>\n\n<p>Here are my computer specs</p>\n\n<p>Memory: 3,8 GiB (I am not sure why.

What happens is during boot it just hangs and then the raid card makes a very loud beep until I reboot. Without their driver installed ubuntu can see the disks but not the raid array. I have followed the instructions <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RocketRaid\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, even though they are old. I also tried those instructions with the newest open source Linux driver provided <a href=\"http://www.highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/series_rr600-download.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> but I am getting the same results. </p>\n\n<p>Kernel: 3.19.0-26-generic</p>\n\n<p>Ubuntu: 14.04.3</p>\n\n<p>How can I help troubleshoot this?

If anyone could suggest one that would be so awesome. I am looking for any Sata/SAS card with 8 internal ports and supports 0/1/5/6/10. </p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I feel I am getting a bit closer. I reinstalled ubuntu to 14.04.3 and installed the driver from source again. Making some changes to the source code according to the tutorial linked earlier. I am able to boot now with the drivers installed and drives turned on, but it is sloooow boot. However, I am able to see the raid array in disks. Well it shows as an unknown block, but it is there (one step closer, I think). But, after about 5 minutes, the raid card just blares its very annoying siren and disconnects the drives and I have to hit the power reset to have it restart again.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the
