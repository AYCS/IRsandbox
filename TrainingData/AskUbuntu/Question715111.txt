One has IPTables/UFW on and enabled. It also has Vesta Control Panel installed. The other server is running some gaming servers, it does not have iptables running.</p>\n\n<p>The problem i'm facing is that i'm wanting my website to get the server status of one of my gaming servers (from server 2). Server 1 (the server that has IPTables running, and VestaCP) is blocking the incoming query traffic from the query it's running.</p>\n\n<p>VestaCP has it's own firewall interface. I've added the port 27017 (the query port for the gmod server) in there for UDP and TCP on IP 0.0.0.0/0 So my understanding is that all UDP and TCP port traffic should be coming through for port 27017. When this didn't work, i installed UFW, and did allow 27017. I also did an \"allow from\" for the External IP of Server 2. So it should be accepting all traffic from that IP. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately it's just not working. When i disable the firewall through Vesta or UFW the query runs fine, but not when it's running. I also tested UFW allowing all incoming traffic, and this allowed it to query. Putting incoming traffic back to the default (deny) it is not querying. </p>\n\n<p>Ontop of this, i can't seem to find any UFW or IPTables logs. I've tried multiple methods to try and get logging working, but nothing is in the syslog or the kernal logs.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated! </p>\n"},{"id":663612,"title":"port forwarding to Arduino device on home network","body":"<p>I have a home server running Kubuntu 14.04.
