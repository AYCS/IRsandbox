While the phone versions of the apps may be impossible to use, but could the tablet versions be converted? One of the reasons my friend keeps giving me against Ubuntu and Linux in general is the lack of really good software. If we could tap into the Android apps though, it would really open up possibilities!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you use a Jailbroken iPhone, you'll notice that all cydia apps are in the .deb form.</p>\n\n<p>And yeah, I'm aware that there is really great software for Linux, but sometimes I feel it lacks, especially in the gaming section (Fingers crossed for OpenMorrowind).
