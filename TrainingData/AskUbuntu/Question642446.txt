In my situation, my AVI files will play correctly in other installed players -- but not in VLC. Unfortunately, I need frame-by-frame controls, and VLC is the only player I have installed that offers that feature. But VLC won't always play my AVI files. It seems to depend on the recording options (such as HD or standard def and frame rate), although I'm not entirely sure why some play and some don't.</p>\n\n<p>Given that some other players on my system play these files, can I assume I have all the drivers needed? The players that work include MPlayer and Dragon player. Everything is fine in those players. And VLC <strong><em>sometimes</em></strong> plays AVI video files.
