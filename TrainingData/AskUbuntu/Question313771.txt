If I go to the Shortcuts control panel and try to bind \"Launch Calculator\" to a new accelerator, pressing the Calculator button does not register at all. It's just not detecting that I pressed it. </p>\n\n<h2>Problem 2:</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>volume up</strong> and <strong>volume down</strong> keys work a little bit -- however once I tap them once or twice, it infinitely keeps pressing the key forever, forcing the volume either to maximum or silent.
