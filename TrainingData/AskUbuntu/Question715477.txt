(I suffered 8+ times during last 24 hours)</p>\n\n<p>When it occur : When I use Firefox (with multiple tabs) and scroll down/up for some page, System hangs. It never occurs on very simple pages (like Linux-related pages or online documents), but It occurs frequently (and randomly) while I`m suffering some pages with pictures, banners, flashes, etc.\nSometimes system stuck on hangs while using (as a foreground) other programs(like Libreoffice), while Firefox have opened already.</p>\n\n<p>I think there are several stages on system hanging.</p>\n\n<p>1) (While I'm browsing with Firefox) Mouse moves, but system does not response. No changes in other windows. (I'm using system-monitor widget for monitoring my system, and If system hangs then updating of widget is stopped) Keyboard sometimes works at that moment. (Not always) So I can use other TTYs by pressing Ctrl + Alt + 1. After move to TTYs, and I usually go back to original gnome session. Then it works <strong>fine</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I can find some logs in /var/log/syslog :</p>\n\n<pre><code>kernel: [  970.227645] [drm:i915_hangcheck_elapsed] *ERROR* stuck on render ring\nkernel: [  970.227655] [drm] capturing error event; look for more information in /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_error_state\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also there are some related logs on Xorg.0.log (I cannot put anything, since it is quite long) : </p>\n\n<pre><code>(EE) [mi] EQ overflowing.

(Ctrl+Alt+number, SysRq Magic Keys, Ctrl+Alt+Del) At that moment,nothing I can do remains, except for push reset button on my laptop. Also, It usually does not gives any information on logs.</p>\n\n<h2>What I`ve tested</h2>\n\n<p>1) Web browser-related</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Removing Adobe flash : Still hangs.</li>\n<li>Removing Addons (like ad blocker) : Still hangs.</li>\n<li>Turing off HW Acceleration : Still hangs.</li>\n<li>Using chrome/chromium : Still hangs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>2) X.org related (<a href=\"http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_Graphics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel_Graphics</a>)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Adding i915.semaphores=1 to boot parameter : Still hangs.</li>\n<li>Changing AccelMethod from sna to uxa : Still hangs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3) Other version of Ubuntu</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ubuntu 14.04 : Still Hangs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>4) Connect gdb on xorg (refer towww.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/ServerDebugging and wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Backtracing) </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When system hangs, connection of ssh is lost (no input or output) and it is impossible to connect another ssh.
