But my problem is that, though I can mount and entire NTFS/FAT partition, I am not able and I have no idea how to mount just one directory from a NTFS/FAT partition without having to mount the entire partition prior to that. I am not sure if this is even possible but if it is possible, please let me know how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>So far I tried command lines like these:</p>\n\n<pre><code>      sudo mount /dev/sda5/movies/Riddick/ /media/hdd/\n\n      sudo mount directory  /dev/sda5/movies/Riddick/ /media/hdd/\n\n      sudo mount /sda5/movies/Riddick/ /media/hdd/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and nothing works. I can mount and read a partition, be it <code>/dev/sda5/</code> or <code>/dev/sda1/</code> but I can't mount just one directory from that partition.
