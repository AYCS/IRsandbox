Randomly, this thing which I think is called \"Unity\" will crash, and I will lose system vitals required to operate the computer.</p>\n\n<p>The icons in the top right disappear, removing my ability to see the time, change the volume, and most importantly, safely restart the system. The bar on the left side of the screen, which I think it's called the \"Launcher\", will also disappear. Sometimes the entire thing will disappear, other times only the icons. 90% of the time when it crashes, the keyboard will also be disabled, preventing me from switching to TTY or opening a terminal. Most builtin applications will crash as well, such as Firefox, Files, Ubuntu Software Center, and Terminal.</p>\n\n<p>I've only been using Ubuntu for about a week, and this all started not long after installing Ubuntu, when I allowed Ubuntu to install some updates to Ubuntu base, and some other things I can't remember.</p>\n\n<p>After installing those updates (I feel this is worth noting). Grub, the boot thingy, also stopped working to some extent, being unable to boot Ubuntu. I did find a work around though. I go into \"Advanaced options for ubuntu\", I am presented with 6 options. If I choose \"Ubuntu, with Linux 4.2.0-16-generic\" or \"Ubuntu, with Linux 4.2.0-16-generic(upstart)\" Ubuntu will boot fine, and if i select \"\"Ubuntu, with Linux 4.2.0-16-generic(recovery)\" then recovery will boot fine. \"Ubuntu\" at the main boot screen, and the other options available in \"Advanced options for ubuntu\" will result in either \"attempted read/write hd0\" or something to do with a kernal.</p>\n\n<p>I have looked around, and nothing seems to be quite my problem.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: It'd be nice if I could get an answer to this soon as it is starting to affect my work efficiency. The last crash happened after only 3 minutes of use.</p>\n"},{"id":708987,"title":"Ubuntu 15.10 - Shockwave crash","body":"<p>I'm on ubuntu 15.10 and shockwave crashes for some videos.

I experience the same behavior of Skype in a fresh install of Ubuntu 15.10. More specifically, when I start Skype immediately after booting into Ubuntu, it will most likely work all right, but if I turn it off at some later time, it will more often than not show up with a completely garbled up and unusable interface such as here (copying the image from the question linked above):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gj08B.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gj08B.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I also observe the same behavior with Clementine. If I open it immediately after starting an Ubuntu session, it will most likely show up ok:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/40VHu.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/40VHu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>but if I start it some time into the session, it will often display a completely broken interface:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YOrHS.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YOrHS.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I suspect this may have something to do with the fact that both Skype and Clementine may be using gtk2, and my Ubuntu install does not have some libraries required for proper rendering of these applications, but I am at a loss of how to diagnose the problem more precisely and fix it.
