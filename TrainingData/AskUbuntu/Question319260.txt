[{"id":319260,"title":"How do I bookmark sections in a PDF file converted from Libre Office?","body":"<p>I have an .odt document I have converted to .pdf, with many different sections, subsections, subsubsections, etc.. In the PDF I want to create a nice bookmark table to easily navigate the document.</p>\n\n<p>The good part is the sections I need bookmarked are either bolded or italized which is different from all text of the document. Presently I'm bookmarking one by one which will take a number of hours but I have no idea where to look for a program to do this task or how to start with scripting this.</p>\n\n<p>Even a program on Windows would help - I guessing it's against the rules to mention Windows, but by some off-chance something like this exists it would save me hours. I'm assuming it doesn't and the only way would have to be by way of a script into a pipe. So if anyone knows how to go about this it would be most appreciated.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":702942,"title":"Libre office - Spacing problem when converting to word doc","body":"<p>Can someone please help? </p>\n\n<p>I typed a doc in double spacing with single spacing for quotes passages.

My original doc is fine, even when i reopen it, but when it's opened in Office the formatting doesn't work.

I installed it using the supplied Canon drivers for Linux\nand I can print wirelessly without problem from every program in\nUbuntu except Libre Office. When I try to print a document (either\nexisting or new, either a .odt or a .doc) the printer icon shows for\nabout 10 seconds and then disappears. Going into ‘view print queue’\nand looking at the document I just tried to print, it says ‘job\ncompleted’, but when I press the refresh button it momentarily says\n‘printer not found’. If I save the document as a pdf, it prints fine\nfrom pdf viewer, but this can only be a temporary workaround. I also\nhave the same version of Libre Office on an old Windoze machine\nrunning XP and I can print from that without any problem, so this must\nbe an Ubuntu issue. I am running 13.04.</p>\n\n<p>I have looked both in the printer settings and the printer settings\nwithin Libre Office and cannot see anything untoward. In have also\nsearched the internet via Duck Duck Go and even, in desperation, used\nMessrs Page &amp; Brin’s search engine, but I could not find anything on\nthis particular issue.</p>\n\n<p>I would be very grateful for any advice on this issue, as I tend to\nprint more from Libre Office than any other program.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"}]}]
