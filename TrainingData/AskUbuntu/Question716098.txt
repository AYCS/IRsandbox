When Wacom decided to re-release their Wacom Intuos Pro series, the current linux-wacom drivers were no good, so I had to go manually build and install the <code>input-wacom-0.20.0</code> drivers to replace the obsolete <code>wacom.ko</code> driver so that it will recognise Wacom Intuos Pro PTH-4xx series, previously known as Wacom Intuos 5 series.</p>\n\n<p>Thing is, the drivers are working and are recognised, however no input is received when I got to use my Intuos Pro PTH-451/K, that is until I got plug in my OLD tablet, my Wacom BambooFun CTE-450/W just to get the drivers to actually work from plugging it into the system so that my PTH-451/K tablet will work.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know why or how, but just plugging in my old wacom tablet initiates the drivers. I won't have my old Wacom BambooFun forever, so I just wanna know a work fix to make it so that the Wacom driver initiates whenever my Wacom Intuos Pro Pen and Touch in plugged in my system.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I can just plug in my BambooFun for a couple seconds and safely remove while being able to use my other tablet just fine, but this really isn't ideal, and need a permanent fix I could add to either a script or modify to the kernel when it loads the drivers at boot.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":387412,"title":"Wacom Intuos Pro PTH-451/K &quot;Tablet not detected&quot;","body":"<p>Having trouble trying to setup my new Wacom Intuos Pro Pen and Touch small (PTH-451), previously known as Wacom Intuos 5.

When I call upon <code>lsusb</code> command it appears to see it is actually there, but it just doesn't want to work at all, and even the LED lights on the tablet show up to show it is being powered, as I have it wired by USB cable. I did try Googling around for answers but I just can't seem to find the answer I'm looking for, I've even tried adding it to the <code>50-wacom.rules</code> but to no avail did this work, so I've been trying to find a solution to making this work.
