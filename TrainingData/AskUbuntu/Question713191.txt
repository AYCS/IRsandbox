The HDD consists of:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Some small partition that seems to be for some EFI stuff</li>\n<li>a partition that holds /boot</li>\n<li>some free space at the end of the HDD</li>\n<li>and in between a partition (lvm?) that was created using the full disk encryption option of the Xubuntu install wizard</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>No. 4 holds the actual system (except /boot of course) and a swap partition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I did:</strong>\nBeing tired and under time pressure, I deleted No. 4 (using gparted). I intended to delete some partition on an USB key but wasn't paying attention (stupid, I know). As everythign was still working I thought I had deleted said USB Key partition and still saved files to the then already deleted partition. All went fine, so I didn't think anything was broken.</p>\n\n<p>I switched off the computer, when I turned it on again it wouldn't boot. It takes a long time (obviously searching for the gone lvm-partition) and then sends me to a initramfs prompt.</p>\n\n<p>I found out testdisk was some utility to recover deleted partitions. I tried out some rescue system (ALT Linux) with testdisk 6.14 and then, when I realized there's a version 7 of it, I even tried testdisk 7.00 (static). This gives me (I treid quick search and deep search) more then the one partition I was looking for, so I hesitated doing anything I don't fully understand.</p>\n\n<p>After an internet search, I found out that I could use hexeditor to look for the luks header (by searching for '4c554b53babe'). I did find two luks headers on the drive. One at</p>\n\n<p>One at 0x206FEBD4/0x7470C06000</p>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<p>one at 0x2F500000/0x7470C06000</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I presume:</strong>\nI presume that the actual data is intact, as I only deleted the partition in gaparted which I think only means some altering in the partition table, so resetting the partition table to normal would set the whole system back to normal.\nI do have /boot so I should be able to decrypt the lvm partition and then get to the presumably intact ext4 partition.\nI am not sure if I need to know the exact size of the lvm partition (as noted, there was some free space at the end of the drive, I don't know why, it wasn't much and this was how the Xubuntu install left it) or if that might be stored somewhere in the luks header or somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I hope:</strong>\nI hope that by some command line magic I am yet not capable of, I can reset the disk to normal so I can boot into my system as I always did.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the lengthy explaination, I want to provide you with a smuch info as possible.
