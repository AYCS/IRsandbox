On Ubuntu 12.10 I had to download RTL8188C_8192C_USB_linux_v3.4.4_4749.20121105 because the built-in rtl8192cu driver did not work on the 64bit system (Tested fine on 32bit). Now I have upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 and of cause the switch from kernel 3.4 to 3.8 broke the compatibility with the driver source. And (Like I suspected), the 64bit issue with rtl8192cu has still not been resolved. Since Realtek has not yet provided a new driver source, I have no working network on my computer (I use USB Tethering from my mobile at the moment). I tried downloading the Windows driver and set it up with ndiswrapper, but as soon as I activate the ndiswrapper module while having that driver installed, I get a kernel panic. </p>\n\n<p>Since I cannot be the only one using this USB Adaptor, I wanted to see if someone else might have found a solution to get something working?
