When I open up VirtualBox and click \"Settings\" for the Ubuntu vm, do I go to \"Storage\" and try to see if I can mount it there, or do I go down to \"USB\" and attempt to mount it from there? When I tried the latter, and clicked on \"Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller\", a warning popped up from VB saying I needed to download VBox extensions to be able to select that option. So I downloaded the extensions and am unsure of what to do next. When I get into Ubuntu, how can I access the external hard drive via the command line?

I do not know what drives sda1, sda2, and sda5 refer to exactly, but apparently I have an extended partition since it goes from sda1 and sda2 to sda5. When I created space for the Ubuntu virtual machine through VBox, I think I only created one main partition and one for the swap, so why is fdisk showing me 3 partitions, unless one of them is referring to the plugged in USB external hard drive, but I don't think that is it because I have not done anything else in the VBox settings for USB? </p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions will be appreciated :-).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have a Western Digital external HD of around 2TB; Windows 7 for some reason no longer allows me to open it: when I plug it into my laptop (via a USB 2.0 port), Windows either does nothing or asks me to format the drive because it doesn't recognize the file system.
