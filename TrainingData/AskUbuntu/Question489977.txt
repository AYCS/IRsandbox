I downloaded 13.10 to replace Windows ME.  I chose to download it and save it onto a memory stick through a Windows laptop.  On Windows ME computer I downloaded Lubuntu through to a USB stick, then used the option of trying it before making the decision to scrub ME from the system. </p>\n\n<p>It seemed to download well and I made the decision early on to make use of the option to scrub ME and run solo on Lubuntu.It seems to fire up well and quickly. Clicking on anything provides a quick response and so on. However. the visible non functioning parts (in my inexperienced opinion) are:</p>\n\n<p>1 - You have to hover over files and apps to be presented with the associated icon. Not all files and apps are icon less but 90% are.</p>\n\n<p>2 - It will not offer my wireless hub as an option for connecting wirelessly.  I subscribe to Sky Internet as part of my TV package.</p>\n\n<p>The hub is the newer one provided by Sky - Model SR101.  My two laptops work well with this hub wirelessly.</p>\n\n<p>3) - The DVD drive does not perform well in two areas. Firstly the button to open and close the drawer does not always work since uploading Lubuntu.  When inserting a DVD, it offers the actual folder of the chapter which if double clicked does play.  It does not join the chapters together to provide what I would call a normal DVD/VCD user experience.  Again it the icon appearing with the name of the chapter is intermittent and most do not have the icon with the name.</p>\n\n<p>Of all the points above my must have is not being able to connect to my wireless hub.\nOn the subject computer wireless connection is attained through a dongle plugged into a USB port.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst the dongle (which is new) only came with a windows driver I think it works OK in Lubuntu as it offers next doors wireless connection as the only choice for connecting wirelessly (my modern laptop confirms this option as a nearby wireless connection offering).</p>\n\n<p>I have not tried connecting to my Sky internet using a direct line feed as Iâ€™m not sure if that proves anything in that I would not want to use it in that way in any case.  However if it is advised that I do this I will.  Any help would be much appreciated. The other points are should haves.  I would be grateful for any help you can give?  Should I try and reinstall Lubuntu in a different way for example. </p>\n\n<h3>Here is a system report</h3>\n\n<pre><code>Processor AMD Athlon(tm) Processor \nMemory 248MB (145MB used) \nOperating System Ubuntu 13.10  \nLG CD-RW CED-8120B  \nKernel Linux 3.11.0-12-generic (i686) \nDesktop Environment LXDE (Lubuntu) \nMisc \nUptime 44 minutes \nLoad Average 0.19, 0.18, 0.21 \n\nProcessor \nName AMD Athlon(tm) Processor \nFamily, model, stepping 6, 4, 4 (AMD Athlon (Thunderbird)) \nFrequency 1302.23MHz \n\nMemory \nTotal Memory 248244 kB \nFree Memory 13952 kB \nBuffers 35688 kB \nCached 89568 kB \nCached Swap 0 kB \nActive 84380 kB \n\nHost bridge VIA Technologies, Inc.

The last time I had it on was a couple days ago, and I had no network problems. Today, I can't get reliable network access. Trying to ping www.google.com gets me anything from \"unknown host\" to 75% packet loss. I've been able to load the Google homepage once, but then I'll get dropped from the network.</p>\n\n<p>I've got a Toshiba Satellite S855-S5378 with a RealTek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC right beside it running Windows 8.1 with no network issues, and a couple mobile devices that aren't having network issues. The machine running Ubuntu is the only one having problems.</p>\n\n<p>I've got some superficial Linux experience, but I'm definitely well in the \"noob\" category when it comes to networks and connectivity (Linux or otherwise). This kind of feels like a driver issue to me, but I'm clueless. </p>\n\n<p>While writing this on my Windows laptop, my Ubuntu machine has been erratically connecting to and disconnecting from my home network. Where do I start in trying to fix this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>It might also be useful to add that when I'm plugged in to the network, I have no issues. This is strictly a problem when I'm trying to connect to the network wirelessly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>The requested wireless info output can be found here: <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/9707958/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/9707958/</a></p>\n\n<p>FYI: The \"shayler\" network is the one I'm trying to work with. \"freedompop\" is my mobile hotspot. Any other networks are irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Okay, so after a lot of back and forth, and attempting a few suggestions, I'm starting to suspect my router. I've done some more extensive testing on my hotspot, and when that has a strong connection, the Ubuntu machine has no trouble staying connected and delivering great speed. I have a NETGEAR wnr2000v3 running the latest firmware (V1.1.2.6) and I'm going to see if I can find any known issues there. If anyone has any tips, thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm still missing something. When I use my mobile hotspot, I have no connectivity issues at all. But even when connected to my home network I can ping just about any domain successfully from the command line. I get the same responses I get from the Windows machine. </p>\n\n<p>I've found a couple posts that say \"if you can ping a domain, but your browser still can't navigate to a website, try...\" and I've tried those. I've turned off IPv6 and checked my DHCP settings. I haven't found any known issues.</p>\n\n<p>Should I still be thinking driver issues, or are there other options?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2015-01-21</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don't know why I didn't think to check this before, but when I use the laptop in the same room as the router, I have no issues. I would think, then, that this is potentially about router placement, but again, I've got 5 other devices within arm's reach of my Linux laptop that aren't having issues. and I wasn't having issues with the Linux laptop until recently. </p>\n\n<p>Today I reset the router to factory settings, and then I tried my Ubuntu laptop again. I had an excellent connection for about a minute. I was able to load a couple of web pages, and then I tried to play a video from YouTube and everything ground to a halt. I shut down the browser and tried to get 50MB of updates using the Synaptic Package Manager, and the download never even started.</p>\n\n<p>I've been walking around my basement office, and I'll intermittently get and then lose the signal--sometimes while staying in the same spot.</p>\n\n<p>Is it as simple as having a shoddy wireless card? Or is it a cruddy driver? We've had the router for a while, and I'd be tempted to blame that if it weren't for all these other devices running smoothly.</p>\n"},{"id":560691,"title":"Wireless card not working?
