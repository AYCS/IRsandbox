It works fine when I have DynDNS set up to the local IP Address 192.168.x.x. But I know that this means that other people can't access my website. When I go to the DynDNS website and change the IP address to what is my public IP, if I try to access my website \"shredalert.homelinux.com\" it takes me to the login page for my router. I am completely boggled as to why this occurs. This is my first time trying to set up a web server and website. Please have some patience if I make really silly comments/assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>I should add that I have already forwarded port 80 for 192.168.x.x.

Would very much appreciate if someone who uses \"names.co.uk\" could tell me how I could utilise the domain name I have registered.</p>\n"},{"id":609110,"title":"Ensuring fail-safety of an Apache server","body":"<p>I have a few Wordpress websites running on Apache 2.4.7 / Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS. It is a virtual machine running on Microsoft Azure. The websites are using a MySQL server also running on the same machine. From time to time, the websites become unresponsive and the Apache needs to be restarted. Investigating the error log (<code>/var/log/apache2/error.log</code>) reveals the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[mpm_prefork:error] [pid 5761] AH00161: server reached MaxRequestWorkers setting, consider raising the MaxRequestWorkers setting\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are the contents of the Apache configuration file (<code>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mpm_prefork.conf</code>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mpm_prefork_module&gt;\n        StartServers             5\n        MinSpareServers          5\n        MaxSpareServers          10\n        MaxRequestWorkers        256\n        MaxConnectionsPerChild   1000\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have raised the <code>MaxRequestWorkers</code> to the maximum number allowed (256), but it still keeps happening.
