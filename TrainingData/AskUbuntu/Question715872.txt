Is there a way I can somehow make the package to always automatically <code>--purge</code> itself whenever a user does a regular <code>apt-get remove mypackage</code> ?</p>\n\n<p>The reason is that I have some config files in /etc that should really be removed when the binaries are removed, otherwise it can lead to weird behavior. However I still want to treat them as conf files, i.e. make sure apt does not just wipe them on every upgrade of the package. But they should be removed when the package is uninstalled.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I am manually deleting the /etc conf files in my postrm script. However I just found out that this has a unfortunate side effect: if the user uninstalls and then later re-installs the package, the conf files won't be reinstalled, because apt thinks that they are still there. So is there a way I can manually trigger a full 'purge' in my postrm, such that apt knows that the conf files are gone?</p>\n"},{"id":98044,"title":"Package operation failed due to incorrect version of Python","body":"<p>I tried to remove/add several python packages and always got the error message \"Package operation failed\" (using the ubuntu software center).\nWhen I tried to remove e.g. python-scipy using the terminal, I got the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;pcfun27@pcfun27:~$ sudo apt-get remove python-scipy\n&gt;Reading package lists...

Out of (probably bad) habit, I rely on Ubuntu for a number of my Python packages, including <code>python-django</code> and a lot of <code>python-django-*</code> extras. The websites require these to run but as long as the package still exists, this isn't an issue. I do this rather than using VirtualEnv (et al) because I <em>want</em> Ubuntu to install security updates.</p>\n\n<p>However the Ubuntu repos don't cater for everybody.

When you update Python (as occasionally happens in Ubuntu), you lose all your <code>pip</code>-installed packages.</p>\n\n<p>What terrifies me is the deeper I get, the more servers I administer, there's going to be an OS update one day that requires hours and hours of my time running around, testing sites, reinstalling python packages through <code>pip</code>.

Something that stored a local list of installed packages, checked for updates like <code>apt</code>, managed installing, etc. <strong>Does such a thing exist?</strong> Or is it a rubbish idea?</p>\n"}]}]
