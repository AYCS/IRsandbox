There's a lot of talk about this on <a href=\"http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19382502.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">other</a> <a href=\"http://forum.notebookreview.com/dell-xps-studio-xps/602663-dell-xps-15z-wireless-issues.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">forums</a>, and it appears to have something to do with the Bluetooth interfering with the Wireless.</p>\n\n<p>So, to explain where I'm at: I can get connected for about 15 minutes before it disconnects and won't connect again. Selecting my network from the list just makes it sit there for a while before it asks me for the password <em>again</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing which is very strange and VERY annoying is that if I disable Bluetooth via the gnome panel ( <code>B</code> -> Disable Bluetooth), it turns off <strong>both</strong> the bluetooth <strong>and</strong> the wireless, and THEN I can't turn it back on because it claims that \"wireless is disabled by hardware switch\", and the same for the Bluetooth. Even restarting from here doesn't help. The actual hardware switch (<kbd>fn + F2</kbd>) does nothing at all, unless I boot into Windows, which is obviously less than satisfactory.</p>\n\n<p>So! I don't use any Bluetooth devices at all, so perhaps if I <em>actually</em> disable it, then the wireless might come back. But I don't know how to do that...</p>\n\n<p>Any help or advice?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Debugging information:</p>\n\n<pre>\n$ sudo lspci -nn\n\n00:00.0 Host bridge [0600]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family DRAM Controller [8086:0104] (rev 09)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200/2nd Generation Core Processor Family PCI Express Root Port [8086:0101] (rev 09)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0126] (rev 09)\n00:16.0 Communication controller [0780]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 [8086:1c3a] (rev 04)\n00:1a.0 USB Controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 [8086:1c2d] (rev 05)\n00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller [8086:1c20] (rev 05)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 1 [8086:1c10] (rev b5)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 2 [8086:1c12] (rev b5)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 4 [8086:1c16] (rev b5)\n00:1c.4 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 5 [8086:1c18] (rev b5)\n00:1c.5 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family PCI Express Root Port 6 [8086:1c1a] (rev b5)\n00:1d.0 USB Controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 [8086:1c26] (rev 05)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge [0601]: Intel Corporation HM67 Express Chipset Family LPC Controller [8086:1c4b] (rev 05)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller [0106]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family 6 port SATA AHCI Controller [8086:1c03] (rev 05)\n00:1f.3 SMBus [0c05]: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family SMBus Controller [8086:1c22] (rev 05)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: nVidia Corporation Device [10de:0df5] (rev a1)\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation Centrino Advanced-N 6230 [8086:0091] (rev 34)\n04:00.0 USB Controller [0c03]: NEC Corporation uPD720200 USB 3.0 Host Controller [1033:0194] (rev 04)\n05:00.0 System peripheral [0880]: JMicron Technology Corp.
