I like it because it lets me use my xbox controller as a mouse, and switch profiles. I've read that xboxdrv lets you do the same, but I've never been able to get that working.</p>\n\n<p>The next thing that I want to do is to have the profile switch when I run certain programs, and then switch back when they close.

I have found <a href=\"http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/doc/x228.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this method</a> to launch the game and switch the profile, but it doesn't look like it will switch back.
