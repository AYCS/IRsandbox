When I issue <code>mount -a</code> AFTER I have edited the <code>fstab</code> I can sometimes get it to work.

The host machine is Windows. </p>\n\n<p>I have a couple of Virtualbox shared folders being mounted by /etc/fstab. Until recently this setup worked just fine, but after upgrading from Ubuntu 13.04 and Virtualbox 4.2 (at essentially the same time) the fstab mounting stopped working. I get the following error during boot:</p>\n\n<pre><code>An error occurred while mounting /home/benme/Documents.\nkeys:Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Pressing M for manual recovery and then trying to mount manually also fails:</p>\n\n<pre><code>root@benme-vb:~# cd /home/benme\nroot@benme-vb:/home/benme# mount Documents\n/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: No such device\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But if I instead skip mounting during boot, wait for Unity to start and then mount manually in a shell, everything works fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>benme-vb ~ % ls Documents\nbenme-vb ~ % sudo mount Documents\n[sudo] password for benme: \nbenme-vb ~ % ls Documents\n    # actual file list omitted\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that when I mount manually I'm letting mount take all the options from /etc/fstab, and it works. This suggests to me that it's some sort of timing issue, where Virtualbox isn't \"ready\" to provide the shared file mounts at the point /etc/fstab mounts are run during bootup.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the fstab line, just for completeness:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Documents       /home/benme/Documents   vboxsf  uid=benme,gid=benme,dmode=774,fmode=664     0   0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there something I can do about this from the Ubuntu side? Or does anyone happen to know more about this from the Virtualbox angle?</p>\n\n<p>I've found an old report on the Virtualbox bug-tracker with identical symptoms, but in that case the user had updated Virtualbox without updating their guest additions and resolving that fixed the problem; this isn't happening here, I've definitely got the 4.3 guest additions installed.</p>\n"},{"id":252853,"title":"How to mount a VirtualBox shared folder at startup?","body":"<p>I have Ubuntu installed in Virtualbox.
