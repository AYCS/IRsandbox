On a normal startup, the computer boots to a black screen.  If I press <kbd>F6</kbd> on startup and boot from the non recovery, I will get to the user selection screen. But, it by default wants to be in unity 3d so it only takes up the top half of the screen, bottom half is black.  My understanding is that this is because its in Unity 3d not unity 2d.  The file <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code> reads as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[SeatDefaults]\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\nuser-session=ubuntu-2d\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am not sure what to do next.
