The chrome extension can be added by going to your web browser settings(for chrome this should be in the top right corner slightly under the close box. Under settings you will have a tab for extensions where you can add extension from a link at the bottom. This will take you to a database search screen, type in chromecast. </p>\n\n<p>This search should pull up a window displaying apps first, and extensions under.\nYou will want to install the googlecast extension and the VideoStream app from the top (In the off chance that Videostream is not listed just perform another search for it specifically and it should pop up).\nGoogle cast will allow you to cast your website to the chromecast device. VideoStream will allow you to stream videos from your LinxOS to the chromecast device. Further more your system should automatically update you applications menu with a tab titled \"google apps\" where you can easily access Videostream.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this was helpful for everyone looking for options on how to use chromecast with their OS =) \nI tried to explain everything in the best details possible seeing that I can't even drop pictures in until I have a rep of </p>\n"},{"id":407839,"title":"Chromecast - tab casting problem","body":"<p>Just got Chromecast and it is set up, working successfully for YouTube and all the other \"optimized\" best supported stuff.

This is really holding me up, because streaming local movies was/is my main motivation for getting ChromeCast and it seems that running a media server and playing in my own browser is the way to go, at least until we get support for VLC or UPnP streams.
