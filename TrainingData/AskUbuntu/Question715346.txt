I have enough Linux experience (of building kernels etc.), so I could do (at least try to do) the porting myself. The manufacturer has not yet released the source for their ROM, but the drivers for the Exynos chip are available. The Exynos is not the only chip on the tablet, so if the manufacturer doesn't release those drivers, is it still possible?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this is not the right place to ask this question, should I try at CyanogenMod forums?
