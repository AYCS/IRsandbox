E.g. Tracker starts alongside with the Strig/nepomuk stuff, Dropbox seems to load half of gnome into KDE and kwallet starts in gnome even when no application tries to access it. Gnome keyring on the other side starts with KDE for a good reason, but I can't set it up to use my login password as authentication without entering it again to start the keyring. </p>\n\n<p>What are the right settings to separate the two desktops to the maximum possible extent? \nWhere are the files controlling this?\nFor example I tried to use LightDM to have no gdm or kdm running but it seems to mess up some things like keyboard bindings ... </p>\n\n<p>Is there a tutorial out there that I couldn't find while googling? \nAny comprehensive information should help!</p>\n"},{"id":206872,"title":"kde on virtualbox already running gnome?","body":"<p>What is the smartest/easiest way to get KDE installed on a VM that is already running GNOME?</p>\n\n<p>Would it be better to create a complete new VM just for KDE (because they don't work well together?)</p>\n\n<p>If the best way to do this is in fact to create a new VM, on virtualbox the only Ubuntus that it has is 32 and 64 bit, it does not specify gnome or kde, it just defaults I think to gnome.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much for your guidance!</p>\n"},{"id":28891,"title":"How do I setup the look &amp; feel of Gnome applications while on KDE?","body":"<p>I guess the title is self descriptive.
