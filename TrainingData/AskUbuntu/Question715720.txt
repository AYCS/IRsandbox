[{"id":715720,"title":"How to properly setup QHD monitor?","body":"<p>I recently bought a Dell Professional P2416D QHD-Monitor. It supports resolutions up to 2.560 x 1.440. When I first plugged it in I got a max resolution of 1.920 x 1.200. Unfortunately my graphic card only supported 2.560 x 1.440 via DVI cable. Since my QHD-Monitor didn't have a DVI connection I had to buy a new graphic card.</p>\n\n<p>I bought a XFX Radeon R5 230 graphic card which is supposed to support 2.560 x 1.440 resolution via HDMI. After my first boot I was only able to set a resolution of 1.920 x 1.200 again. So I installed <code>fglrx-updates</code> driver to check if it is a driver issue. Now I can set my max resolution to 2.048 x 1.152. Better but not why I bought this monitor.</p>\n\n<p>I re-checked the specs of my monitor and graphic card. I should be able to run my monitor on max resolution but I can't. I have no idea what else I could check.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xI0uN.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xI0uN.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":714393,"title":"Mouse flickering and disappearing from primary display on a dual monitor setup","body":"<p>I've been trying to set up dual monitors on my system for some days.

Multiple Monitors","body":"<p>I have two graphics cards in my computer and I'm having trouble getting them to play nicely with my 4 monitors. Before upgrading to Ubuntu 15.04 from 14.10, I had all 4 working together nicely, though performance was dismal. All 4 of them could be enabled at the same time, too. </p>\n\n<pre><code>$lspci | grep \"VGA\"                                                 \n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

And the 3450 is connected to a third monitor.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing the X.Org X Server driver in Additional Drivers is very broken. Only one monitor is detected, Ubuntu says that it is a laptop display, and it has a low resolutions.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing the fglrx and fglrx-updates in Additional Drivers both react the same way as each other. Only the devices that are connected to the 5850 are detected and only 2 of them can be enabled at once. Attempting to enable the third device returns the following error: </p>\n\n<pre><code>The selected configuration for displays could not be applied\ncould not set the configuration for CRTC 112\n\nFailed to apply configuration: %s\nGDBus.Error:org.gtk.GDBus.UnmappedGError.Quark._gnome_2drr_2derror_2dquark.Code2: could not set the configuration for CRTC 112\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried to purge and uninstall the fglrx and fglrx-core and reinstall them from the AMD website but I'm not sure if I did it properly. They failed half way through and the .log file was vague. Upon restarting, graphics didn't work at all and I had to uninstall them from the console, reboot, and restore from my TimeShift Rsync backup. </p>\n\n<p>Some other bugs that are occurring that I'm assuming are related to graphics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I can't open Chrome without creating two instances of it. If I simply open one, it will sit in my Windows list and I clicking on it does nothing. Opening a second instance allows me to open the first and then I can freely close the second.</li>\n<li>My Ctrl+Alt+F1/F6 TTYs are just blank screens. I can still log in and issue commands but no text appears or anything. </li>\n<li>When I boot to the login screen, I get the could not set the configuration for CRTC 112 error and have to clear the message box before I can log in.</li>\n<li>Occasionally there are random graphics errors with programs. Spotify panes occasionally just turn blue until I click into the program and Chrome occasionally bugs out and has massive graphical mismatching errors until I kill the process and restart it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At this point, I'm not really sure how I should proceed. Do you guys have any ideas? </p>\n"},{"id":597596,"title":"Dual Monitors with AMD video cards","body":"<p>First off, I'm a little new here. So please forgive me if I'm making any mistakes with my first post here. I need a bit of help here. I have a system with two AMD graphics chips in it. My primary one being my HD Radeon 6850 card and my secondary one being my APU's built-in GPU. (A10-6800K.)</p>\n\n<p>I want to use my primary monitor on my HD Radeon 6850 and my secondary monitor hooked up to my A10-6800K's GPU. My thought process is to let my A10-6800K's GPU take care of the workload for my secondary monitor so I can help save resources on my primary card/monitor.</p>\n\n<p>This all works fine right out of the box with the open source drivers. But as soon as I switch over to the proprietary drivers, my primary monitor/card stops working, resulting only in video output from my secondary screen.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought in trying to correct this is going to the AMD Catalyst Control Center (in sudo mode) and seeing what I can do there. I noticed that the CCC reports both of my cards there, so at very least my system still recognizes my primary card. However, the options for it are very limited. By default, it has the card disabled. And when I do enable it, it does not allow me to change any of its properties. It only has one resolution listed for as well. (680x420) So I can't even change this. And just for the heck of it, I gone ahead and enabled the monitor this way just to see if I could get the card to work at all. But after the required reboot, CCC switches the card back to disabled, putting me back at the start.</p>\n\n<p>I checked Xrandr. However, it only displays information about my secondary GPU. I used lspci | grep VGA and found even there that it shows my primary GPU. So it seems to me that while the system sees my card, it's not actively being used by the X server, thus why Xrandr didn't display it.The only thing I could come up with is that the X.server isn't loading it up. And when I went and put sudo Xorg -configure in the terminal, it wouldn't let me run the command because the server is still running on my secondary GPU. I closed out the X server with sudo service gdm stop. After that, I ran sudo Xorg -configure. And it created a new xorg.conf file to run off of. I then did a mv xorg.conf.new xorg.conf command to rename it and then moved it to the proper folder with mv xorg.conf /etc/X11/. I assumed it would allow X server to run on my primary GPU. However, it didn't work for whatever reason. So I'm still at a loss.</p>\n\n<p>And I'm not sure what I can do to make this work under the proprietary drivers. I get the feeling that it is probably something simple I am overlooking, that's why I need help. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>As some side notes, I made sure that dual graphics is disabled and that the computer treats my primary PCI Express card as my main display in the UEFI options. I'm doing all of this under Ubuntu GNOME 14.10.</p>\n"},{"id":518101,"title":"How can I use monitors plugged into my graphics card and motherboard?","body":"<p>I've decided to try out Ubuntu on my desktop, but I've ran into a problem. When I first booted into it, it only detected my small monitor plugged into my motherboard. I thought of this as a non-issue, as I know Ubuntu doesn't use nonfree drivers by default. So after install, and upgrade, I selected non-free drivers for my graphics card and rebooted. Expectedly, My two monitors plugged into my graphics card are now working and fully functional. However, my monitor plugged into my motherboard is now disabled. I went to display settings, and it does not appear as a device. What can I do to use all of my monitors?</p>\n"},{"id":288144,"title":"Three monitors connected to AMD 7970, only HDMI works","body":"<p>Just made a clean install of Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit on my desktop machine with an AMD 7970 graphics card installed.
