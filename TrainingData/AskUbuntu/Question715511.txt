When I type a space, it prints .-M. I have to copy&amp;paste a space every time to write this text. When I press the backspace key, it deletes the last letter, but it also toggles fullscreen of the current windows and sometimes writes an h. The arrows also write weird characters, e.g. the left arrow introduces \"opU\". The enter key also doesn't work properly, and it introduces the UÑ characters when pressed, unless I use shift-Enter.

Then I turned it off and went to dinner. After I came back, the on board keyboard was not working. When I was trying to log in, I pressed the first button, it prints an o and gets stuck, then starts printing like a hundred o's before going on and printing hundreds of other keys that I pressed. I tried the editing grub and sudo upgrade thing. It seemed to work after sudo upgrade when I used my usb keyboard to do it, but after reboot, it started to get stuck again. And after I log in with my usb keyboard, it doesn't even recognize there is on board keyboard, the caps lock with a light doesn't work.
