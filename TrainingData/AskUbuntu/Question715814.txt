I have been looking around and can't seem to find a straight answer on some questions I have.</p>\n\n<p>First off, is Ubuntu for Phones actually a full fledged distribution or is is stripped down to be more of a phone-like OS? Would I be able to download programs that are available for linux? Be able to run .deb packages? Open a Terminal?</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, is there a way to install the latest distro of Ubuntu onto my mobile device? In replacement of Android (for experimental purposes)? The only answers I can find is to VNC into it on your phone, but it is still too slow and laggy. I understand one would have to pull the drivers from one owns device but surely this is possible?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time in reading this and I am very interested in hearing your thoughts or information leading me to my answers!</p>\n"},{"id":260182,"title":"Is ubuntu phone for android devices only?","body":"<p>I have a palm pixi plus and I would be delighted to install ubuntu phone software on my phone.</p>\n\n<p>palm pixi plus phone specifications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>600mz processor</li>\n<li>256mb ram</li>\n<li>8gb storage space</li>\n</ul>\n"}]}]
