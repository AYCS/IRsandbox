Upon researching, I found out that I actually have Intel Integrated HD Graphics on my i7 L640 cpu, which is a Sandy Bridge model, which fully supports OpenGL3. I've tried updating the drivers using the Intel Installer, but it hangs on committing a certain part.

I have a 2012 MacBook Pro with an Intel HD 4000, if that helps in the matter. And of course if there are other ways to get drivers for this particular card-I remember being able to do it straight through the Additional Drivers program back when I had an Nvidia laptop-that would be great too.
