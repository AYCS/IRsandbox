I recently bought an SSD for my laptop - which is about 6 years old - and made a clean Windows 8.1 install on it. However, after an \"accident\" - I had forogt to plug power in and laptop died from zeero battery with zero warning -  Windows 8 became unusable. Being fed up, I decided to erase Windows 8 and install Ubuntu.  </p>\n\n<p>So I inserted the 14.04 cd, and chose to replace the Windows 8 system. However, after the installation was completed without a problem, I then procceeded to restart my system and the Ubuntu system would not boot. Nothing would appear but a blank terminal with a cursor awating input (??). I tried to use the Boot-Repair program in the Live CD environment, but it showed me a strange message, saying that it ccould not operate because it was executed in Legacy Mode, and that I needed to execute it in EFI mode. Note that several times I had installed ubuntu before, I had used boot-repair without such problems.  </p>\n\n<p>Following the instructions, I put the boot-repair image on a usb, but the laptop would not boot from usb,printing a message like the following: <code>Try hd(0,0): EXT2</code>. I had set the boot order as it should be.  </p>\n\n<p>After the above, I re-installed Windows 8 and it has no problems installing and booting. Therefore, I guess installing Windows 8 cleanly led to it messing up somehow with my bios - my system is old so it does not have UEFI. Any suggestions to work this thing around and get an Ubuntu system running?</p>\n"},{"id":614532,"title":"No boot device found - boot repair","body":"<p>My HP laptop is not able to find a boot device at startup.

I didn't really know how to fix it, so I used a LiveUSB of Ubuntu in order to use the boot-repair tool (by running the Try Ubuntu option and downloading boot-repair) to regain access to Windows. I ran it, and it said that the boot was successfully repaired and it was safe to reboot. I did as such, but Ubuntu took a long time to shutdown, so I thought it must have been some error and I did a force shutdown. </p>\n\n<p>After turning on the laptop, it said that bootmgr was missing, and the only option given was to restart the computer, and after restarting 5 times, it still said the same message.
