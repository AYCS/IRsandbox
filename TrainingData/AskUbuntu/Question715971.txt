I know I can go back to OpenOffice if I want to but Oracle seem to be more interested in lawyers than FOSS and I'm sure LO will be a lot better in a short period of time.</p>\n\n<p>The only problem I have found switching is a strange (irritating) difference which doesn't seem to have a config setting that I can change. In OO When I select an image and insert a new one it will \"replace\" the original using the same dimensions in LO this is not the case the image is simply added to the page whether you select an image on the page or not.</p>\n\n<p>I did find an OO extension which provides the same functionality</p>\n\n<p>Change picture extension - <a href=\"http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/ChangePicture\">http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/ChangePicture</a>       </p>\n\n<p>The main issue is the extension doesn't use the \"working directory\" of LO so you have to navigate to the correct directory each time (censored). As I will be doing this for 4 pictures per document and over 1000 documents and possibly many more in the future my sanity is at stake.</p>\n\n<p>So if any one has any insights on the easiest way to solve this one thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"id":500579,"title":"Opening hyperlink in LibreOffice Writer","body":"<ol>\n<li>I am inserting a hyperlink into OpenOffice Writer on a highlighted word - 'the_hyperlink'.</li>\n<li>I am choosing 'Insert' from the task bar and 'Hyperlink' from the dropdown list.</li>\n<li>I paste the link into 'Target' and the highlighted 'the_hyperlink' is already in the Text field.</li>\n<li>Click Apply.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The hyperlink box doesn't automatically disappear (as in, task done) but if I click out of it it has created a hyperlink.  </p>\n\n<p>My Problem is it does not open the hyperlink if you left click on it.

So in theory, this should not be an issue at all. However, the end users love to make straight forward processes more complicated than is necessary, so here I am.</p>\n\n<p>I did some testing: I can save my file (with protected sheet) as a \".ods\" file, THEN save it to \".xls\" format without issue. IF, however, I close LO after saving the file as ods, and then open LO and the ods file AGAIN, and attempt to save as xls, it fails with the error the OP has described: \"Hash incompatible\".</p>\n\n<p>Something is being lost when Libre closes that is necessary for ODS files to be saved with password protected sheets.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>When prompted, if you elect to \"re-type\", you actually get presented with several options. One option is to save without the password. However, the other option allows you to retype WITHOUT verifying a match. I used this option, and after that, the status message changed from \"Hash incompatible\" to \"Hash compatible\". I saved the document as \".xls\" type, then closed Calc.</p>\n\n<p>I then opened calc, and saved it as \".ods\". Closed calc again. Opened the \".ods\" file, and attempted to save as \".xls\". Would you like to overwrite? Yes I would! And I got the password retype message again.</p>\n\n<p>So, however the hash was saved the first time I retyped the password (overwriting the old hash?), it was not saved correctly because the hash was incorrect upon the same process a second time.</p>\n"}]}]
