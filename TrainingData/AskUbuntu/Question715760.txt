Worked perfectly. 2. Attempted apt-get update and it requested that I do dpkg --configure -a which worked. 3. Then it said it would take effect after reboot so I rebooted. 4. Upon reboot it has no USB, Wifi USB, Wifi card, or ethernet support. ifconfig shows no adapters. lsusb finds the adapters and identifies everything properly. But they do not appear anywhere else. Only my phone connects via USB and is discoverable. At times the CLI says I have 491 updates to do but I can't since I'm offline. So far trying to install offline options have failed.

I have a desktop that I installed Ubuntu on, I am very new at this so I don't know anything. I have been spending countless hours looking up how to get my computer connected to the internet. It has a hardwired connection plugged into it which I know works because windows works fine. I have a Gigabyte 990fx-ud3 motherboard with an integrated ethernet adapter. It is a realtek rtl8111/8168/8411. On top of this my Razer Blackwidow keyboard does not work in Linux. I can fix that once I get an internet connection established but for now I am using a temporary ps2 keyboard. I have followed most guides of adding things to the interfaces file. Manually setting network info and so on. So far none of them have worked. I would really like to get this working.
