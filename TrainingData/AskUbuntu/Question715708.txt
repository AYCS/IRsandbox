[{"id":715708,"title":"After Ubuntu update steam is not seeing games","body":"<p>I have an Acer C720P Chromebook running Crouton, trusty 14.04.I believe  after a recent OS update, Steam cannot find my games anymore.

I have  been doing a lot of reading, trying to find a solution, but alas none yet. </p>\n\n<p>Something similar happened a month or so back, and I did get it fixed, but I can't remember for the life of me how I did it. </p>\n\n<p>When I open Steam using terminal I do get this interesting error message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(steam:18522): LIBDBUSMENU-GLIB-WARNING **: Trying to remove a child that doesn't believe we're it's parent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So far  have tried resetting Steam, but didn't seem to work.</p>\n\n<p>I have also tried re-installing the games, but I don't have enough memory for that.</p>\n\n<p>I have also tried to add steam library folder, but haven't found the right one yet, as I don't know my way round the Crouton foler strucutre that well yet. I also get an error message saying: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>New Steam library folder must be empty</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have read about other people using Ubuntu coming across similar issues, but they have got round it by booting up a previous version of Ubuntu by pressing shift at the booting screen to get round this issue. However, that will not work on Crouton, nor do I know a why to run an older version of the OS without doing a restore. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone got any tips?</p>\n\n<p>Like I said, I managed to fix it before, but really can't remember how.</p>\n\n<p>Cheers</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":710510,"title":"Steam won&#39;t launch Ubuntu 14.04 LTS","body":"<p>Just as the title says, I can't get it to open at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>Details: I'm using an Nvidia card, and when Ubuntu was freshly installed on my laptop, I could download and install both Steam and Nvidia drivers and get them to work no problem, I've even played games for 5 days without any inconvenience. But then one day, steam decided to stop loading with the infamous error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found\nlibGL error: failed to load driver: swrast\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now here's the case, I've spent like 6-8 hours trying to solve this, going to various forums looking for solutions, here's what I've done so far(at least that I can remember):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Deleting Nvidia driver and Steam in various orders through various methods, restarting computer like 20 times in doing that. (fail)</li>\n<li><p>Tried to figure out why it couldn't pick up libGL by trying to open that little gear spinning program, that should fail the same way steam does and show why it did, but it didn't fail and showed basically bugger all to me (fail)</p></li>\n<li><p>I've done all the system updating, everything I could imagine, still no results (fail)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Additional IMPORTANT (I guess) info: Now I've got them both installed and I've found that if I select Intel HD graphics card, I can load steam, but if I've Nvidia selected, no luck. Interesting thing to me is, that I can run other linux programs and even games (Like Doom 2 modifier Zandronum) it is just that Steam refuses to work, when Nvidia card is selected.</p>\n\n<p>Last bit: While providing help, keep in mind that I'm a complete novice at Ubuntu so try to keep it as simple as possible, also, I maybe could of done something wrong in the second method or misunderstood something, that's also a possibility, lastly, if I need to provide any other information, just ask nicely, I'll do it as fast as I can.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Don't hesitate to ask 'Have you tried doing X?'
