Personally, I was hoping to be able to use the touch-screen a lot, but it has been buggy to the point of being useless for everything from playing flash games to clicking on buttons and opening programs.

Shouldn't the same behavior occur on the touch-screen?</p>\n\n<p>Three finger touch issues:</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes three finger touch brings up these white arrows that let me move and resize windows. Other times, three finger touch does nothing. Somewhat inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>Four finger touch:</p>\n\n<p>Perfectly brings up the Ubuntu launch menu every time. The only thing that works consistently is the four-finger touch gesture.</p>\n\n<p>So, for anyone else with the Dell Sputnik, are these touchscreen issues just on my computer, or are they systemic to the XPS13 Developers Edition model as a whole?</p>\n\n<p>p.s.
