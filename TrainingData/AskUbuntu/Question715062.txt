[{"id":715062,"title":"Datafiles in Thunderbird Mail for backup/export","body":"<p>I am a novice user of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64-bit) using kernel 3.19.0.42-generic. I have had multiple problems with older kernels - probably of my own making! I was unable to login with these older kernels but have eventually been able to update and use the recovery kernel above to repair most of the damage. There are still a few issues and I think I would rather do a clean install to ensure everything is working as it should. I have backed up all my data from the offending partition, but am unable to see how to backup the Thunderbird mail messages and contacts. I am using Thunderbird Mail 38.4.0 (an update on the pop3 version I was using previously) that contains imported Outlook data that I am desperate to keep. I would greatly appreciate any assistance to export the data out of Thunderbird and then import it back to to a nice sparkly new install, but there doesn't appear to be an import/export utility in this version of Thunderbird. </p>\n\n<p>I do need fairly simple instructions as I am not as confident working with Ubuntu as perhaps I should be ..... but maybe that's because it has been so stable up to recently, I didnt have to tinker .... lol!</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks,   </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":694117,"title":"How to Back Up Account in Thunderbird","body":"<p>I have a Thunderbird account installed on windows pc, I am planning to use my new computer with Ubuntu.

I'm going to rephrase this entry to highlight the solution in case anyone else searches and ends up here.</p>\n\n<p>I had to re-install all my data from a saved backup. I use thunderbird and wanted to keep my old saved emails. To create this backup I had copied the folder /home/[USERID]/ onto an external backup along with all its subfolders. To save emails, inside this folder is a subfolder .thunderbird/ , and inside <em>that</em> is another subfolder that has a name consisting of some random characters: let's call it [old_folder_name].default. So on my new system, I now had to take what was saved on the external hard drive (HD) in  /home/[USERID]/.thunderbird/[old_folder_name].default/ and import it to my local machine.</p>\n\n<p>Following advice I was given below, I launched thunderbird from scratch (after deleting the previous ~/.thunderbird folder to make sure I was starting clean) and then closed it again. That created a new folder inside ~/.thunderbird/ which I'll call [new_folder_name].default/ . I then copied the <em>contents</em> of [old_folder_name].default/ into [new_folder_name].default/ and relaunched thunderbird. </p>\n\n<p>Normally, this should work. The reason I was having problems is that the external HD I was using wasn't giving me adequate permissions to manage these files, so I had to go to [new_folder_name].default/ and use </p>\n\n<pre><code>$ chmod -R 777 *\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which might actually be a bit <em>too</em> permissive (I'm not sure if this is a security liability), but I just wanted to get something working.  </p>\n\n<p>To answer a question below: my external drive was using Ext4 formatting. To create the backup I had been doing this every once in a while:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ rsync -rv [directory to be backed up]  [directory to send to it]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>sending the data from my local HD to the external media to back it up, and then vice-versa to put it back onto my local HD. I had assumed that that would preserve the same permissions (I kept the same username, although I did change the name of my PC in my new OS installation).</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone suggest a way to rsync without running these sort of permission problems? (or, alternatively, another way to back things up where I can review the contents?)\nthanks again for your help.</p>\n"},{"id":528136,"title":"thunderbird mail contacts backup","body":"<p>Do you know how I can back up my address book in Thunderbird mail.
