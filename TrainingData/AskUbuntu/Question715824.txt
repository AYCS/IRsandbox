There is a specific channel called the unofficial Appstore.  This is where there are more channels, ie. reddit full movies channel, adult movies channel, etc. just extras that Pplex does not consider official. Now in order to get the channel on Windows &amp; I just downloaded the zip file and windows did the rest.  For Ubuntu I was reading to do it I had to download, save to plex plugins file, unzip, change ownership and it shoudl be complete.  I was about to get the \"master.zip\" downloaded ffrom github.com/mikedm139/UnSupportedAppstore.bundle into my plex plug in folder.

Ever since this server has been running, our power bill has been way more than usual for an obvious reason. I recently decided to test migrating everything to the cloud just to make everything a lot simpler, and for a fun project. I am now trying to use Amazon S3 for file storage and Digital Ocean with Ubuntu 14.04 to host the transcoding computer. I have had partial success, but am having trouble getting Plex to discover any media on the mounted S3 drive. I use transmit to SFTP to the Droplet from Digital Ocean and see the mounted S3 folder and media, but when I pull up Plex and point it to the destination, it doesn't see anything inside the folder. I am thinking this is a permissions error with the folder, but I ran <code>chmod 777</code> for the folder where the S3 bucket was mounted, but Plex still sees nothing in the folder. I tried this with Fuse as well and had the same result, but am going with S3QL because it uploads files in 10mb chunks, so the entire file isn't required to access one part of one file, therefore saving time and bandwidth.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the guides I used:</p>\n\n<p>Plex install: <a href=\"https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/26727-how-to-plex-media-server-on-ubuntu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/26727-how-to-plex-media-server-on-ubuntu/</a></p>\n\n<p>S3QL install: <a href=\"http://ubuntuservergui.com/ubuntu-server-guide/mount-s3-ubuntu-server\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ubuntuservergui.com/ubuntu-server-guide/mount-s3-ubuntu-server</a></p>\n\n<p>I also ran <code>sudo gpasswd -a plex plugdev</code> to give Plex more permissions.</p>\n"},{"id":469052,"title":"Where does Plex media server store its cache/settings?","body":"<p>I just want to know where to find the cache/settings locations for Plex Media Server?

I have converted a spare machine to a media server using windows 7, but it got very very slow to the point where I couldn't use it any more.\nAnyway to cut a long story short, I swapped to Ubuntu (the latest stable version 13.10 I believe)  today and I'm trying to use it along side PLEX (I've read great reviews).</p>\n\n<p>So far, I'm pretty sure everything is as it's meant to be. Ubuntu is running so smooth and quick in comparison to Windows 7 and I've installed PLEX.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I can't seem to get PLEX to find any of the folders I want to share on my media partition. Someone suggested I change the permissions on the partition to suit PLEX, so I've right clicked on the partitioned drive icon and set the sharing options accordingly as I would have done with windows. I've noticed the permissions tab, but Ubuntu won't allow me to change the permissions for the group (which I think is what I need to do) ...please can anyone advise me further?</p>\n"},{"id":398961,"title":"Plex media server and mount issues in Ubuntu 13.04","body":"<p>hopefully it's not too much of a newbie question......</p>\n\n<p>so, i have decided to drop plex media server onto an Ubuntu install in order to provide my house with a stable platform that will maximize availability. I had considered setting up an old WinXP machine to do this, but figured that i would get the most out of older hardware on Ubuntu, and that it would make full use of all the RAM as it's a 64bit OS instead of 32bit.</p>\n\n<p>that being said, I'm having some issues. My machine is currently an older: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>13.04 64bit.</li>\n<li>AMD2.7 dual core w/ </li>\n<li>8GB RAM</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>my Linux knowledge is pedestrian at best, but I do have some command line experience.  my question is thus......</p>\n\n<p>I have finally moved all my media over from a Windows 7 MCE machine that we were using, but was slowing down tremendously.  apparently Plex does not support sub folders and I had to redo my directory structure again, as I want to separate my video files into kid friendly categories (same with my music files). Because of this, i used <code>gparted</code> to create several different logical volumes that will be mounted independently from one another, and allow me to create different repositories within Plex, that our kids now they can access.</p>\n\n<p>I know that the naming convention of the media (movies, tv progs, music, etc) must be adjusted so that Plex can find them.  however, I have done some reading and have found that this is probably not the only issue that I may be having. I have read other threads that indicate that the permissions on the volumes need to be <code>777</code> in order to allow Plex to access them, or Plex needs to be added to my default <code>usergroup</code>. This is not a concern, as I am probably going to be the only one accessing anything on the server, and i am comfortable with <code>chmod -R</code> enough to have fixed that. Additionally though, I read that the volumes are mounted with a default <code>/media</code> mountpoint and that this is the real underlying problem.  I read that the mountpoint needs to be changed to <code>/mnt</code>. In order to do this, it would appear as though I need to edit <code>/etc/fstab</code> in order to change the mountpoints.  I found this guide: <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MoveMountpointHowto\" rel=\"nofollow\">MoveMountpointHowto - Community Ubuntu Documentation</a> </p>\n\n<p>My question is after moving all my files into my directories and having them mount at <code>/media</code>, should I back the files out in order to change the mount point? Or perhaps a better way to phrase it, will my data still be in the partition after I change the mountpoint or will it be lost?  another set of questions, is this even necessary?  is there an easier way to change the mountpoint?  while i am somewhat ok w/ using the command line, i would prefer a GUI option as my Linux-fu is far outdated. Alas, i have been unable to find anything that is reliable and all the posts i have read is that editing the <code>/etc/fstab</code> is \"easy\".  i'm afraid that the \"how to\" article referenced above is something that I'm not 100% comfortable with, although it appears to be very well written.</p>\n\n<p>thank you in advance for any input/feedback/assistance!</p>\n"},{"id":294607,"title":"Accessing Plex and Transmission remotely","body":"<p>I have setup plex and transmission to be accessed through the webui.
