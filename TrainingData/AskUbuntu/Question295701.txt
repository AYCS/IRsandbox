I have read a few pages about liveCD with persistent image and I have found it quite useful for my purpose (which is trying Ubuntu and, especially, its applications without messing with my laptop's Windows 7). Using the method explained in <a href=\"http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14912/create-a-persistent-bootable-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive/\">here</a>, I have created an Ubuntu USB flash drive; however, I have seen that the OS is extremely slow in doing ordinary things (even web surfing, which leads to temporary gray screens in Firefox).  </p>\n\n<p>My question is if I install Ubuntu in such a way that the persistent image stays in one of the local partitions of the hard drive (instead of the USB flash drive), would it resolve the problem, or running OS from USB drive will result in a very slow OS anyway? Also, I am not sure how I can install Ubuntu on a flash drive and have one of local partitions on the hard drive be the persistent image. So, any help regarding that will be also appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Soheil</p>\n"},{"id":156026,"title":"Difference between LiveCD, LiveUSB, full-install, and persistence?","body":"<p>I am currently running Ubuntu as a guest vm on a Win 7 host via VirtualBox, but I would like to have a portable version of Ubuntu when I am not using my laptop. </p>\n\n<p>I am unsure as to the difference between the following:</p>\n\n<p>1)LiveCD with persistence;\n2)LiveCD without persistence;\n3)LiveUSB with persistence;\n4)LiveUSB without persistence;\n5)Full-install. </p>\n\n<p>I have a USB flash drive (32GB), and I also have empty DVDs lying around.
