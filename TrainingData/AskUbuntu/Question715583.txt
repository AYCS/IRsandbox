I would like to create swap and home partitions but do I need to create separate swap and home partitions (one each), for both Lubuntu and Puppy?  I'd like to have a single home and swap partition for both Lubuntu and Puppy to maximize disk space and keep working files if I delete an OS. </p>\n\n<p>Also with respect the Puppy Tahr install, does the Puppy partition need to be a primary partition as well or logical?

Finally I found a way to bypass the grub2 resque error so I could start Linux Mint 17.1 Live cd (trough usb) and installed Linux Mint 17.1 on the sda5 partition (I format Ubuntu completely). So I solved the Grub2 resque error by creating a new partition with bios_grub flag (2mb) because the previous bios_grub partition was deleted. The only problem I still get is that when I start my laptop he boots into Windows 8.1 so I have to start my laptop and push F11 for the BIOS Boot Manager and then I can choose between Windows boot manager or Ubuntu or ubuntu (when I choose Ubuntu or ubuntu the Grub boot screen appears and I can choose Linux Mint 17.1 rebecca). So the problem is I get no Grub2 boot menu when I start my laptop (also push shift doesn't works). The problem begin after installing Ubuntu 14.10 over Linux Mint 17.
