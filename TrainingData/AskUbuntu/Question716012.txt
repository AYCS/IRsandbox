Now it doesn't show any partitions (see attachment). and says \"unallocated space\" whereas it is allocated and there is data that are really important and I cannot afford to lose.\nI want to ask is there any way out to recover this information. I have already used testdisk and it has found three partitions successfully whereas the fourth one is still missing. If you recommend using the same software (testdisk) kindly guide me how can I find the fourth one as well and how can I recover them later on (after finding the right partitions). I don't know if it is duplicate or not but as far as I have searched on this site, most of the posts were not helpful. Posts related to testdisk has worked for me to some extent but still I am confused. If you mind asking like this, kindly remove this question. I don't mind. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
