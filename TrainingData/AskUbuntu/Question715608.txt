Windows 7 was installed on the SSD, so I went ahead with installing Ubuntu onto the HDD. I used a DVD with Ubuntu written on it and booted from the removable disk drive (by changing the option on BIOS option page). I mostly followed instructions I found from several threads here such as creating \"/, /home, /swap\" (I am planning to do some intensive data processing). I then selected the option of booting from 'sdb' which was the HDD that I was installing Ubuntu on. 'sda' is the SSD with Windows. </p>\n\n<p>However when I restarted my computer, I was able to successfully boot to Ubuntu, but when I tried to change back to booting from Windows (located on the SSD), I could not do so. I was brought to a black screen with 'Windows Error Recovery' indicating that Windows files were 'damaged or configured incorrectly'. I tried to Launch Startup Repair (recommended), but would be brought back repeatedly to this screen i.e. it did not work. So I tried to Start Windows Normally, but was brought to a second page stating 'Reboot and Select Proper Boot Device or Insert Boot Media in selected device and press a key'. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Picture links:</strong> <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Q6419fd.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/Q6419fd.jpg</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/iNwBSZ5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/iNwBSZ5.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>I am not sure what exactly I did wrong.

I am new to linux and brought up a server on ubuntu 12.10.  I wanted to try KVM so I setup /etc/network/interfaces correctly for a bridge.

I happened to place the ethtool command in the wrong location in the file and now the entire server boots to a screwed up GUI and I don't know how to recover.  I could reinstall the server but I am really tired of doing that with ubuntu.  I think the problem is that ubuntu doesn't like my Radeon 7400 graphics card or something so it is really hard to get installed in the first place since it gives a blank screen half the time.  Now, after making this change to the the interfaces file, it screwed up the entire display.   How in the world does changing a network config screw up the entire graphics display?  I am pretty unimpressed with ubuntu at this point.  It seems very unstable and difficult to install.  Any thoughts on how I might recover without another reinstall?  I tried using a live CD but it won't work because it can't seem to recognize the graphics card to give me any type of display.</p>\n"},{"id":38620,"title":"My system takes too long to boot is there a fix?","body":"<p>i just installed Ubuntu 11.04 fresh install with Windows 7 already installed.. when i chose ubuntu from the grub menu it shows the purple screen for too long with no activity from the laptop then after a while it boots normally.
