The ethrenet connects not problems on windows 7 and a few days ago it was working fine on Ubuntu. I was and am using a static IP.</p>\n\n<p>I thought maybe a driver update messed things up so following the instructions at help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide\nI get\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/e3ami.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wireless Troubleshooting results for drivers</a>\nAs a novice I can only say it looks like the drivers are find and that the problem is just getting the driver to speak with the router.</p>\n\n<p>So next, following the instructions at help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide/Connections\nI will note that in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> I have\n<code>iface eth0 inet static</code> and then lines for for dns-nameservers, address, netmask, gateway. These all worked before. Calling <code>cat /etc/resolv.conf</code> I see a nameserver field identical to the dns-nameserver in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code></p>\n\n<p>This looks in order. As a sanity check I pinged Google and sure enough I get a response from my terminal. But still no internet access via firefox  </p>\n\n<p>So I am \"connected but without internet\" or so I believe. The Connections link above has an enry for this and suggests I check my DNS settings and since I'm using a statis IP it tells me I should try the instructions here:\n//help.ubuntu.com/community/StaticDnsWithDhcp</p>\n\n<p>Sadly I cannot find any changes here that I need to make since my <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> already has a dns-nameservers field. I will note that <code>sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart</code> fails to restart. It stops, and starts and then I get \"fail to restart\" from the terminal (I'll have to go back and check the exact message. Typing from windows)</p>\n\n<p>I did find a related question entitled \"How to successfully restart a network without reboot over SSH?\" that mentions that this restart command doesn't work anymore in Ubuntu 14 so I'll read that next.

After installing Ubuntu, I am not being able to access college internet through my laptop. We have a wired network. All students have been provided with separate static IPv4 addresses like 192.168.0.xxx to access the college LAN, and 192.168.0.10 for college net. MacId registration was also done. We were given a port number to use for net connection. The subnet mask was 255.255.255.0. These were the 'only' settings I had to put for accessing the net connection and LAN connection, and all the DNS server, Gateway, etc settings were left blank/not touched in the Local Area Connection settings dialogue box.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I have Ubuntu, when I tried to play an mp3 file, it asked for net connection to download a plug-in. But it was unable to connect as perhaps I have entered the wrong settings, or I am missing out on some of them. I am not being able to figure out what settings must be put where and what should be put for DNS server, gateway etc settings. Asking my administrator was useless. He had never even heard of Ubuntu, and advised me to revert back to Windows.
