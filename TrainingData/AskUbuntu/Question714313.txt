I have no idea as how to undo it. </p>\n\n<p>This, I think, has lead to the problem of me not being able to login. I created a secondary user account, and for awhile I could login to that one, but now I can only login via GUI as guest. I can Ctrl Alt F1 to terminal and login that way, but I cannot get in via GUI, no matter which desktop option I use. I've tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm and sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm, to no avail. I've also tried ps ax | grep lightdm, sudo apt-get clean/purge/autoremove etc., and sudo stop lightdm, sudo Xorg -configure (which I have no idea on what to edit) then sudo start lightdm, which brings up an error of it not being able to start. When I do try to login, whether I have it set to automatically login, enter my password and hit enter or click on the >, it goes to a black screen with some text that appears really quick and then returns to the login screen. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-24-generic i686). \n\n\nOutput of ls -l /home: \ntotal 8\ndr-x ------ 4 phil 4096 Apr 30 15:50 phil\ndrwxr -xr-x 25 phil2 phil2 4096 Apr 30 16:40 phil2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I think this is caused because I had tried to comment out some stuff in the above file due to duplicates, and this is the first time this error has come up. </p>\n\n<p>Output of sudo Xorg -configure: \nFatal server error:\nServer is already active for display 0\nIf this server is no longer running, remove /tmp/.X0-lock and start again.\nddxSigGiveUp: Closing log. </p>\n\n<p>I tried adding the Mate Desktop environment (GNOME 2.0), and still cannot login under my primary account or the secondary account I created. </p>\n\n<p>I managed to unencrypt and move my files from my encrypted home folder under my primary account, but that hasn't fixed the problems either.
