They were so many pros and contras. At the end ubuntu wont be changed, the 6 month cycle system wont be changed. Thats fine! </p>\n\n<p>But because there are so many people who would like to use an ubuntu with RR Im asking myself why isnt there an Ubuntu Derivate with RR. I couldnt found one, there are a loooot of Ubuntu Derivates but no RR. Is it just impossible? I mean Ubuntu = 6 months cycle, so the derivate have to be a 6 month cycle too? Is there no other option?
