You will see<br>\nThe story: I wanted to upgrade my Laptop from Ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10. After applying the update I remembered the situation I was in: I had a black login screen with just a cursor. Last time I just did reinstall ubuntu, because it was the LTS version and I did not feel bad about the upcoming work (since it was an LTS version)<br>\nAfter I got rid of that black screen - I'm still not sure how - I had the lightdm login screen which I exchanged with the 'regular' one. After dealing with ubuntu won't let me login and resending me straight back to the login screen I had the problem that Unity (launcher and top bar) wasn't starting.<br>\nThe main problem at that time was that<br>\n<code>export DISPLAY=:0\n ccsm</code><br>\ndid give me the compiz manager where I could select the unity-api box (which was unticked) so that the unity launcher did show up again, but whenever I restarted there was no unity launcher, no top bar no nothing (except my main desktop background).<br>\nSomehow - again not shure how - I did manage to get back the launcher and the top bar. Since I had some nasty problems with the Xserver on my system in the past I changed the GPU driver to fglrx-updates (which worked perfectly fine in 14.04 !). The download was OK and unlike the few times before when I tried to select it and it reset the ticked box to the Xserver in the ubuntu options. Now I have - at least I guess that I have - fglrx-updates installed and...<br>\n...I'm back to the black screen with the blinking cursor. Hurray for nothing :-(</p>\n\n<p>So I'm not sure what I should do now. Does anybody know what has happened there? Is there a faster way of getting back to my system without spending about 6 hours of my time like I did last time?<br>To be brutally honest: Since ubuntu is one OS on my dual boot machine I thought about removing it completely from my system. Even I somewhat like to work with it I just don't have the time to spend hours on just a black screen and - this is the 'sad' thing for me in that story - I did not ever have such problems with Windows before.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nThis is how I got back to a working (?) system:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd></li>\n<li>log in and run <code>sudo -s</code> to become a root (saves retiping passwords)</li>\n<li><code>sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo apt-get autoremove</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall unity</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager</code></li>\n<li><code>reboot</code> rebbots your system (now I can see at least the login screen)</li>\n<li>if Ubuntu does not log you in but jumps back to the login page help can be found <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/223501/ubuntu-gets-stuck-in-a-login-loop\">here</a></li>\n<li>Again <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd></li>\n<li><code>export DISPLAY=:0</code></li>\n<li><code>ccsm</code></li>\n<li>Make shure the Unity Plugin Box is ticked</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now I have at least a working system where I have a GUI, but I can't play games any longer (like eg.
