I should note that browser activity is sluggish even in simple pages (e.g. Facebook), I'm not talking about watching HD videos on youtube or something. </p>\n\n<p>I suspect the lack of a graphics card is partially responsible (alas, the curse of laptops), but I wouldn't expect this to be such a visible issue.
