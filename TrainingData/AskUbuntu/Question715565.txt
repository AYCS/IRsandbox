But, obviously the question is asking us to use set.  I have never used set before and went to do <code>man set</code> to find out a little bit about the command, but, to my surprise my shell (bash) didn't have an entry for set.  However, I see that there is a set man page here <a href=\"http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html</a> So that is my first question: Why isn't there an entry when I use the command <code>man set</code>?  </p>\n\n<p>I posted on a discussion board that if i just type <code>set</code> it spits out a bunch of function stuff that looks like info from <code>rails</code> which I have installed on my machine.  No idea whats going on there..  My professor explained that set is a \"built in\" function which is why it might not have documentation in the man pages. </p>\n\n<p>After looking at the set documentation online a little bit, I still have no idea how I can get it to spit out my <code>$PATH</code> and after doing a little research I haven't found anything that really explains <code>set</code> well in the context that I need to use it</p>\n\n<p>To be clear I am not simply seeking an answer here, a general explanation pointing me in the right direction would be very helpful.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why can I find a man entry online for <code>set</code> but when I use the command <code>man set</code> no documentation is available in my terminal.</p></li>\n<li><p>What might be a general way to use <code>set</code> to find the directories in my <code>PATH</code></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>edit: The full question: </p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Use the set command to find out all of the directories in your “PATH.” You will get a lot of data and you will need to pipe to another command to filter out just what you want. Please note that PATH is capitalized. Paste or type those directories below. You will get a bunch of data so see if you can dig through it to get the answer.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"id":473257,"title":"bash: config.sh: No such file or directory","body":"<p>Whenever I open my terminal, it displays</p>\n\n<p>bash: config.sh: No such file or directory</p>\n\n<p>followed by the command prompt in the next line.
