This behavior is quite annoying. I cannot launch the update and go away, because sooner or later there will be a popup and the upgrade utility won't do anything until I click somewhere. (The questions make sense.<sup>1</sup> I do not criticize the questions per se, but the way the upgrade utility goes about asking them.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Could Ubuntu not simply perform all the package upgrades, as it is going to anyway, and then, at the very end, display one single pop-up with a list of all those questions, so that I can simply check them off one by one?</em></p>\n\n<p>Bulk-moving all these questions to the end of the upgrade process would be so much more efficient. It would allow me to launch an upgrade in the evening, come back in the morning, and take care of all those little details in one sweep. Technically it shouldn't be a problem at all. The upgrade utility can easily keep track of which files it is going to ask me about. It could even do it on the run, adding questions to the pop-up as it goes, so that users who like the current behavior can stick with it, but the upgrade process won't get interrupted if a user doesn't answer right away.</p>\n\n<p>Summing up, is there a way to move all those questions to the end? If not, is there a reason for this behavior? Generally, would bulk-moving all those questions to the end of the installation process be a good idea? Should I make a feature request?</p>\n\n<p>Should there not be such a feature, and if the question stirs enough interest, I will definitely make a feature request, and we'll see what the devs have to say. :)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>  <sub>On the one hand, if I'm running a server with a lot of customized configuration files, I don't want an upgrade to remove them or mess them up.
