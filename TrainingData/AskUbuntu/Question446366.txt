I can't seem to find a good Linux solution that allows both to work to company standards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Company's Brand formatting</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is essentially a Calibri font/sans-serif; font size:11.0pt; colour#1F497D. Any Linux mail I use must be able to default to that when I write a new message, forward or reply.</p>\n\n<p>This has been set up because the rest of the company uses outlook.</p>\n\n<p>Initially I had hoped to use Thunderbird, and bought an ExQuilla licence which sync's perfectly (though slower than outlook). However the colour #1F497D isn't one of the default swabs for colour choices avaible under Preferences>Composition>General>HTML>Text Colour. I could get the right colour by manually copy pasting the Hex code into the colour selection tool in the write window... but this was fiddly and requires me to keep the hex code constantly on hand... Instead I installed last colour picker, which jumps to the last swab I used. More useful... but still not ideal.</p>\n\n<p>Evolution offers a one up in this respect, I think I can here customise the composition look of my email as per company standards... so I looked to move...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exchange Server 2007 settings</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0000378.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This guide</a> initially looked very good. So i aimed to install evolution and MAPI.</p>\n\n<p><code>sudo apt-get install evolution</code>\n<code>sudo apt-get install evolution-mapi</code></p>\n\n<p>And so I installed Evolution and Evolution support for the groupware suite. I quickly found I couldn't select the correct protocol, however this was resolved by installing the missing dependency, as per <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/326366/exchange-mapi-option-not-available-after-exchange-support-for-the-evolution-grou\">this solution</a> via:</p>\n\n<p><code>sudo apt-get install python-samba</code></p>\n\n<p>This seemed to be working better. I made an account as follows using the evolution account assistant, I've included dummy names.</p>\n\n<p>Full name: Joe Blogs\nEmail Address: Joeb@mycompany.co.uk</p>\n\n<p><strong>The MAPI attempt</strong></p>\n\n<p>So first I tried setting Server Type under 'Recieving Email' to Exchange MAPI.</p>\n\n<p>For configuration my server settings were initially:</p>\n\n<p>server: exchange.mycompany.co.uk\nusername: joeb\ndomain name: [empty]</p>\n\n<p>So i entered domain name in as \"mycompany.co.uk\"... Authenticate... entered by (definitely correct) password.

I can't seem to move to Thunderbird because it won't customise my email in a way that suits my company... and I can't use evolution because of exchange issues... </p>\n\n<p>It be great to get this setup as my entire home setup is Linux... and I have quiet designs to get more of my colleagues to shift given their windows 8 frustrations!</p>\n\n<p>Any advice on resolving this... or a smarter point of intervention (Thunderbird?) would be much appreciated!</p>\n"},{"id":377698,"title":"Is it possible to receive email in &quot;real time&quot;?","body":"<p>I have a POP3 Windows Live/Hotmail account (<code>@live.com</code>).

The setup wizard automatically detected my server settings and this worked well for retrieving the information from the server (like inbox and custom folders).  The sending didn't work by at first.  There was a problem with the SMTP authentication.  I tried each authentication method until I was successful sending a message.  The one that worked was NTLM.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the good tips for this problem!</p>\n\n<p>** UPDATE **</p>\n\n<p>It has been a few days using Thunderbird.  It seemed like it was working at first, but now I see that it is not performing very well.  Every time the program runs, it hangs on \"bringing inbox up to date\".  Also when you first open the program, it seems to retrieve  the new email messages correctly, but after the program is opened, it hangs and will not get new messages that have been sent since opening the program... back to the drawing board.</p>\n"},{"id":292515,"title":"How can I send email from my website on ubuntu server","body":"<p>I am using ubuntu 12.04 and I have installed Appache , php , and mysql all the latest versions.
