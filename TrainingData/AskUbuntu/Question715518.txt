[{"id":715518,"title":"Where can I find a step-by-step guide on how to install Windows 10 AFTER Linux?","body":"<p>I previously used Windows 8, then upgraded to 10. Now, after using elementaryOS for a while and being quite satisfied with it, I was thinking about reinstalling Windows 10 in dual-boot, just to play some games every once in a while.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I know that installing Ubuntu and derivatives AFTER Windows is a piece of cake (I have done it myself in the past), while the other way around is a bit of a mess.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, I'd rather try. Since I'm a bit of a noob, I need a simple, step-by-step guide on how to do install Windows 10 in dual boot (so far, I haven't found any).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and, before someone asks, I'm currently downloading Windows 10 ISO; according to MS's FAQ, it should recognize my hardware (since I registered after upgrading from Windows 8), so the license shouldn't be an issue.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT - a couple more questions:</p>\n\n<p>1) what's the best way to put the Windows ISO on a USB disk? For Linux Live USB I've always used UNetBootin, but I'm guessing it's not going to be of any use in my case.</p>\n\n<p>2) Here are my partitions:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/T9Az0.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/T9Az0.png\" alt=\"Just a screenshot\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Should I just increase the size of the unallocated space?
