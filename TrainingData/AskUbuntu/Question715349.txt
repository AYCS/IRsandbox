I know this is possible because I have this configuration working on a different machine, but I don't believe anything special was performed to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>I have Ubuntu 14.04 64bit installed on my laptop, and have removed gnome-screensaver using \"sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver\".  I've added an entry to the startup applications to run \"xscreensaver -no-splash\".  If I wait 5 minutes, the screensaver starts up as expected, however when I move the mouse I find it returns me to an unlocked session.  In case you're wondering, yes I'm waiting until after short timeout where it would otherwise allow me to wake up the session without needing to type your password.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried playing around with various configurations under System Settings / Brightness &amp; Lock.  The options I've tried setting are ensuring that \"Lock\" is enabled, and setting \"lock screen after\" to 5 minutes.  However this seems to have no effect.  I was actually wondering if this was due to the removal of gnome-screensaver.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried following the steps under the apps man page, however it requests me to modify /usr/share/applications/gnome-screensaver-preferences.desktop which doesn't exist (I believe because gnome-screensaver-preferences is no longer shipped with gnome-screensaver, and is uninstalled in any case).</p>\n\n<p>I then found a slightly different version of the man page here:\n<a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xscreensaver.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/xscreensaver.1.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Under the GNOME heading it asks you to modify the same file as before, that also doesn't exist.</p>\n\n<p>I'm at a bit of a loss really.
