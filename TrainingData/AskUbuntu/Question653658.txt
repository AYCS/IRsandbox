I have Lubuntu based on version 15.04; I'm very satisfied, though it's more complicated than windows, but faster and safer. Now I want some help with creating a wifi hotspot on my laptop using incoming connection from wired ethernet. I have read and watched many tutorials but neither helped me. The problem is that I can't install ap-hotspot from Terminal, as it says \"Unable to locate package ap-hotspot\". Is there any other way to do this? I'm using Dell Inpiron B120 old laptop with 512mb ram. Adapter is Broadcom 4318 and all drivers and firmware are installed.
