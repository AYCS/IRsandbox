[{"id":715483,"title":"My Battery Precentage keeps going Up and Down?","body":"<p>I recently started using Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on my Asus K53E laptop, and it was working pretty well since September. But in November I noticed the original battery started get old &amp; hold less of a charge when it hits 100%. So I decided to get a new OEM battery. Once I received the battery in December, the computer started to hold a charge longer and thought that corrected the issue. However what became worse is that every time I unplug the A/C from charging the laptop, it will show the charge Percentage jump up and down; at least until the laptop just shuts off from how inaccurate the battery's charge is. I'm not sure what it could be, but suggestions are welcomed.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":688693,"title":"New battery is stuck at 72%, says it is charging, but unplugging the charger will shutdown the computer","body":"<p>I just bought a battery for my <code>Alienware M14x r2</code> laptop.

I am using my laptop with the power cord plugged in at all times because i essentially use it as a desktop. Never leave the house with it and never will. Don't use the battery, since i don't want it to overcharge and do any damage.\nThing is, there's power outages.\nWhat i am looking for are two things (permanent changes):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>a way to set a charge limit on the battery so that it doesn't get damaged. for example i want my battery to stop charging when it is 60% or 80% full. this way the battery's life is extended</p></li>\n<li><p>a way for ubuntu to automatically shut down (a proper full shutdown saving everything just like i would manually shut it down from the interface) my laptop when the battery reaches a certain lower level such as 20%. this way when there's a power outage, the laptop switches from power cord to battery, and even if i don't notice the outage my pc doesn't just all of a suddden blackout damaging files and the harddrive, as it does when it's only plugged in the power cord (with the battery unmounted).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What software/programs or terminal commands can i use? What ways are there to do this?</p>\n\n<p>Don't tell me about tp-smapi or tlp since i don't have a thinkpad. and also no ubuntu tweaks since i saw that the power management options don't have what i need.</p>\n\n<p>Now i don't necessarily want to customize the upper charging limit and lower critical battery limits myself if it isn't possible, but i just want them to at least exist and be able to trigger those settings.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>\n"},{"id":650074,"title":"battery is not being charged or used","body":"<p>My battery is 89% charged, but as soon as I pull out the power cord from my laptop the laptop electricity supply is killed (and the computer shuts down).
