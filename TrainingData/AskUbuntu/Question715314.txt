Unfortunately I believe it is not a software error. To find out what was going on I installed a ScreenKey which mirrors keystrokes to the screen. What was happening was that the keys on the laptop keyboard near the <kbd>F3</kbd> key were activating that key, causing it to stick. The truly strange thing is that merely touching the laptop screen on the left side is enough to activate the <kbd>F3</kbd> key. This seems to be a hardware issue, the laptop will be replaced this weekend and hopefully this will alleviate the problem. </p>\n"},{"id":622212,"title":"Ctrl + Shift + U not working in MS Office 2007 under Wine","body":"<p>I have to deal with this problem on another family PC on which I forced Linux installation over Windows.</p>\n\n<p>I'm well aware that <kbd>Alt</kbd> + Number doesn't work on Linux, that's why I was relying on <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> combo, which works absolutely fine in Libre Office.

This is very difficult with a standard Ubuntu install since things like ctrl+c seem to be set in stone whereas to mimic OS X behavior, it would need to be cmd+c. Anyway, I'm less interested in discussing the why and more interested in discussing the how. I'm not adverse to writing a daemon in Python, C or whatever else might be needed (I'm also somewhat comfortable with standard UNIX apis). I am, however, completely ignorant about where to begin with something like this.</p>\n\n<p>When the keystrokes are intercepted and processed, it should be able to send them back to the OS following the same interface that the strokes were originally sent with. Maybe this would have to be a patch to X itself? Or would something be able to be in place between the keyboard and X?</p>\n"},{"id":292606,"title":"Missing keystrokes in ubuntu 13.04","body":"<p>This has only been a problem since upgrading to Ubuntu 13.04 from 12.10.
