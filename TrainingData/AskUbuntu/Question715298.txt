The problem appears if and only if I turn on VPN at work, put the computer to sleep, and wake it at home. The vpnc client does not run any longer, but apparently some configuration still lingers (I will dive into that over the next weeks). When at home and I run another vpn connection, and then disconnect with <code>vpnc-disconnect</code>, my problem disappears. The <code>11n_disable</code> option has no influence on this behavior.</p>\n\n<p>I thank both contributors with an upvote, but -- sorry -- not with the bounty. However, <strong>the bounty is still to have</strong> for the person who will either explain to me what is happening or give me a guide how to debug the vpnc problem.</p>\n"}]}]
