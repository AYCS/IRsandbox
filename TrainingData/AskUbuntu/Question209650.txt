Everything seems to be working great.</p>\n\n<p>The only small issue I'm running into is that I can't figure out how to make XBMC launch automatically on boot/restart. In the 'Startup Applications Preferences' dialog in Ubuntu I have added a new launcher with the command</p>\n\n<pre><code>/usr/bin/xbmc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and ticked the checkbox next to it. When I restart though XBMC doesn't launch. I know this is the correct path because I ran</p>\n\n<pre><code>which xbmc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in the Terminal to confirm it.</p>\n\n<p>Am I doing something really stupid here? How come XBMC won't launch automatically? It works fine if I click its icon in the dock.</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks,</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":679229,"title":"How to autostart nitrogen on boot","body":"<p>I am using nitrogen to span my wallpaper over dual monitors.
