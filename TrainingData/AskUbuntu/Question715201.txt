Ubuntu installed quite easily on my Windows 10 laptop despite the secure boot stuff. Evidently Microsoft signs Ubuntu loaders so that it is acceptable for their secure boot system. Whatever. It works. </p>\n\n<p>Now I have a different problem. Firstly, I have to hit F12 at boot to see the Microsoft boot loader. Otherwise it just loads into Windows. That is not a big deal really. But it would be nice to just show the loader automatically. Not sure if anything can be done about that. </p>\n\n<p>But what COULD be done is switching the order of the OS's displayed in the Microsoft loader. It loads Windows by default, so if it is not displayed (by hitting F12) it just loads windows. But if I select Ubuntu, it THEN loads the Grub2 loader, which has the selection on it for Ubuntu or Windows (with Ubuntu as the default). Seems to me that if I just set the Microsoft loader to load Ubuntu by default, I would not have to hit F12 or even SEE that loader as it would just show Grub2. </p>\n\n<p>For clarity, here is my boot sequences:</p>\n\n<p>Not pressing anything extra:</p>\n\n<p><strong>press power.\nloads Windows 10. (never shows grub2 or the windows loader)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dual boot by Pressing F12:</p>\n\n<p><strong>press power.\nDisplays Microsoft boot loader, showing Windows 10 as default and Ubuntu.\nSelect Ubuntu\nDisplays the Grub2 boot loader, showing Ubuntu as default.\nSelect nothing, loads Ubuntu</strong></p>\n\n<p>What I propose is making Ubuntu the default in the WINDOWS boot loader, so that my new sequence would be:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Press power:\n(Windows loader as default selects Ubuntu, and then loads Grub 2 by default without pressing anything)\nGrub2 displays, \nI select Windows or it just loads into Ubuntu by default.</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I installed Ubuntu I just let it do things automatically. I installed it to a USB, which booted fine, ran it from USB to test it, all devices on the laptop worked, so I installed it from inside Ubuntu. I selected the automatic setup for dual boot and did not make partitions myself (other than selecting the size for Ubuntu by moving that divider bar). </p>\n\n<p>Hope that is enough info. The Windows 10 version is the upgrade from Windows 8. I tried installing other versions of Linux that don't have the Microsoft approved-to-load signature and they failed every time to even get to a desktop from USB live. But of course, Ubuntu is \"signed\" by Microsoft to have the boot key necessary to work. The version of Ubuntu is the latest version as of this post, downloaded today.
