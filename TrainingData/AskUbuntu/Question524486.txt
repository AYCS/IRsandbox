System Display GUI can see both displays but can only mirror the displays successfully. By fiddling with Display GUI and ARandR, I temporarily managed to get an extended desktop working, but NVidia GUI still only sees one of the monitors and if I try to reboot with 2 monitors attached, the GUI is totally glitched and unusable after login.</li>\n<li>During boot, the system just uses the left monitor (via HDMI i/f) for display, so I presume this is treated as the primary display. However, after boot, it appears the system switches to using the Display Port for the primary display and the system will not let me have the Ubuntu launcher only on the left (HDMI) display. The only options that work are for having the launcher on both or just on the right (Display Port) monitor. I tried to forcefully fix the issue with the primary monitor incorrectly being set to the right monitor by changing the primary monitor switch in ~/.config/monitors.xml, however this does not work and causes both monitors to appear at strange resolutions and glitch badly with uncoordinated mouse input.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Running  <code>/usr/lib/nvidia-340/bin/nvidia-xconfig --query-gpu-info</code> gives</p>\n\n<pre><code>Number of GPUs: 1\n\nGPU #0:\n  Name      : GeForce GT 650M\n  UUID      : GPU-...\n  PCI BusID : PCI:1:0:0\n\n  Number of Display Devices: 1\n\n  Display Device 0 (DFP-0):\n      EDID Name             : DELL U2412M\n      Minimum HorizSync     : 30.000 kHz\n      Maximum HorizSync     : 83.000 kHz\n      Minimum VertRefresh   : 50 Hz\n      Maximum VertRefresh   : 61 Hz\n      Maximum PixelClock    : 170.000 MHz\n      Maximum Width         : 1920 pixels\n      Maximum Height        : 1200 pixels\n      Preferred Width       : 1920 pixels\n      Preferred Height      : 1200 pixels\n      Preferred VertRefresh : 60 Hz\n      Physical Width        : 520 mm\n      Physical Height       : 320 mm\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running <code>xrandr --query</code> gives</p>\n\n<pre><code>Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 3120 x 1920, maximum 16384 x 16384\nDP-0 connected primary 1200x1920+1920+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   ...\nDP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nLVDS1 connected\n   1600x900       60.0 +   40.0  \n   ...\nDP1 disconnected\nDP2 disconnected\nHDMI1 connected 1920x1200+0+0 518mm x 324mm\n   1920x1200      60.0*+\n   ...\nHDMI2 disconnected\nVGA1 disconnected\nVIRTUAL1 disconnected\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running <code>lspci | grep VGA</code> gives</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n  01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107M [GeForce GT 650M] (rev a1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My xorg.conf is almost empty but I believe 14.04 automatically detects those settings.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":706617,"title":"How to set up triple monitors in 14.04 with NVIDIA GTX980M","body":"<p>I'm used to working with three monitors at the same time (laptop monitor + two external monitors). However, I don't seem to be able to get it working on my Ubuntu 14.04 with a GTX980M + Intel configuration which has three video outputs (One HDMI + two DisplayPort). It works perfectly on Windows so I guess it's more likely a Ubuntu configuration issue. The model is Clevo P650 (known as Sager 8658 in the US or 神舟 战神 Z8-KL7S2 in China). I have installed the NVIDIA proprietary driver version 355. Strangely, on the <strong>login</strong> screen, <em>all three screens</em> display Ubuntu background correctly, as shown <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/110904311/2015-12-06%2023.01.25.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, once I log in, only two screens can coexist at the same time: If I leave out a cable, whether at HDMI or DisplayPort, the laptop monitor displays normally with the one remaining external monitor. However, if I keep both cables plugged in, then the laptop monitor goes dark and only two external monitors are displayed.</p>\n\n<p>I tried running <code>sudo nvidia-settings</code>, however only two displays are shown there, as can be seen in <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/110904311/2015-12-06%2023.35.54.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">the photo</a>. I tried to create multiple X screens in the configuration, but strangely, the settings that I wrote each time via \"Save to X Configuration File\" seem to get lost whenever I login again, as <code>xorg.conf</code> gets reset to its initial state. It seems that the settings written are invalid. I Googled a while, but the questions seem to be dealing with older versions of Ubuntu/NVIDIA drivers. I couldn't find where I might be able to configure <code>TwinView</code>. I'm currently at a loss as of what to do next. Should I try to manually write a <code>xorg.conf</code>? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: The situation with <code>nouveau</code> is even worse. Although <code>lspci -vnnn | perl -lne 'print if /^\\d+\\:.+(\\[\\S+\\:\\S+\\])/' | grep VGA</code> seems to show that both the NVIDIA and the Intel cards are working, no external monitor seems to be recognized at all.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>xorg.conf</code> written by <code>nvidia-settings</code> by default (without attempting to create multiple X screens) seems to be this one. The strange thing is that it seems only one monitor (on HDMI) gets recognized although I connected two, not to mention the internal monitor on the laptop:</p>\n\n<pre><code># nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n# nvidia-settings:  version 358.16  (buildd@lcy01-29)  Sat Nov 21 02:54:29 UTC 2015\n\n# nvidia-xconfig: X configuration file generated by nvidia-xconfig\n# nvidia-xconfig:  version 355.11  (buildmeister@swio-display-x86-rhel47-07)  Wed Aug 26 17:15:49 PDT 2015\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"layout\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    Inactive       \"intel\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"keyboard\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Samsung S27D590\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     50.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"intel\"\n    Driver         \"intel\"\n    Option         \"AccelMethod\" \"SNA\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:0@0:2:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"nvidia\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:1@0:0:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 980M\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"intel\"\n    Device         \"intel\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"nvidia\"\n    Device         \"nvidia\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration\" \"on\"\n    Option         \"IgnoreDisplayDevices\" \"CRT\"\n    Option         \"ConstrainCursor\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n        Modes      \"nvidia-auto-select\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"HDMI-0: nvidia-auto-select +1920+0, DP-2: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT2: Now I realized I can't actually run the internal monitor together with just one external monitor either.

They all should run at 60hz, except for my gaming monitor, which runs at 144hz.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My problem:</strong> When watching video, or even just smooth scrolling down a web page, I experience horrible and distracting horizontal tearing. This is the case on all my monitors <em>except</em> my 144hz gaming monitor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the cause of this, and is there any way to eliminate the tearing?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My hypothesis is that since I have a 144hz monitor connected, everything on the X display is rendered at 144 frames per second. Since most of my monitors only run at 60hz, they get vertical tearing. I have tried all the following commands for changing the refresh rate of my 144hz to 60 without success:</p>\n\n<pre>xrandr --rate 60.00 --output DP-1\nxrandr --rate 60 --output DP-1\nxrandr -r 60 --output DP-1\nxrandr -r 60.00 --output DP-1</pre>\n\n<p>And I have tried prepending \"sudo\" in front of them all. The commands produced no output and changed nothing.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I now managed to set my gaming monitor to 60hz using this command:</p>\n\n<pre>xrandr --output \"DP-1\" --mode \"1920x1080\" --rate \"60.00\"</pre>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is still tearing, now even on the gaming monitor! All my monitors are now tearing when watching a simple video. Is my X display still rendering at 144 fps?
