I've tried everything @Fabby and @user3541816 have suggested: I've uninstalled the drivers, installed the generic ones when adding a printer, then reinstalled by right-clicking on the files to install from the Software Center. My computer shows the printer and gives me no errors when I try to print a test page (just says Idle), nor does my printer.</p>\n\n<p>In the Printers settings menu, I select: Add, Canon MF8300C ([IP Address]), under \"Connection\" \"AppSocket/JetDirect network printer via DNS-SD\" then \"Generic (Recommended)\" on the next page \"text-only (recommended)\" and left the default name and description (there isn't a pre-installed one for the Canon MF8300C series which is why I must use the generic ones). Then I installed the proprietary drivers (common first) by right-clicking and installing through the Software Center.</p>\n\n<p>From here, I'm stuck on what to do. The instructions say to restart CUPS then enter /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p [Printer Name] -m [PPD file] -v lpd://[Device IP address or FQDN]/[Printer Name] -E as the root user, and I used the same [Printer Name] as the one installed using the generic drivers. This still didn't work. I also tried going into the properties of the installed (generic drivers) printer and changing the make to use the now-installed Canon drivers and that still didn't work.</p>\n\n<p>I'm running 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04.2.
