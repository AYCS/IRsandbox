I used my good OS to look at both its and the 'bad' OS's latest [by date] Xorg.conf files - they are quite different and I don't know if this could be the problem. I can post them if needed. I have a three monitors as one desktop - but they were all working fine...until something happened and can't figure out what...!?!</p>\n\n<p>The only other thing I can think of that changed at about the time this began was a new kernel installed, but all kernels, even older ones, don not got into GUI desktop now.</p>\n\n<p>....I'm really at wits end!

I needed to change ownership of several (sudo-related) files. I used <code>pkexec</code> to change ownership using the terminal.
