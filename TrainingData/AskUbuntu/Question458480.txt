[{"id":458480,"title":"Why do cdimage.ubuntu.com and releases.ubuntu.com list different images?","body":"<p>There are two places I go when I want to download Ubuntu installer images: <code>cdimage.ubuntu.com</code> and <code>releases.ubuntu.com</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these appear equally official: they are both subdomains of <code>ubuntu.com</code>, and the main Ubuntu website makes references to both for its download links.  (<a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads\">http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads</a> uses the former for its 'Network installer' download links, and the latter for its 'BitTorrent' download links, for example.)</p>\n\n<p>If I visit <a href=\"http://releases.ubuntu.com/\">http://releases.ubuntu.com/</a> and follow links for the current Ubuntu release, I reach a page that lists numerous links to desktop and server installer images.  Likewise, if I visit <a href=\"http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/\">http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/</a> and follow links in a similar manner, I get to another very similar page that also gives numerous links to desktop and server installer images.  At the moment, these pages are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/\">http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/release/\">http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/trusty/release/</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Following '14.04' links instead of 'trusty' leads to pages identical to the above, aside from their URLs.)</p>\n\n<p>The language used on those two pages suggests that <strong>each page lists all of the available image files</strong>. For example, they each say \"A full list of available files, including BitTorrent files, can be found below\", and they each provide a wide variety of link types (<code>.iso</code>, <code>.torrent</code>, <code>.metalink</code> etc).</p>\n\n<p>Neither page makes any reference to the other page's existence, and for a long time I thought that these were simply two different URLs serving essentially the same list of installer images.</p>\n\n<p>Right?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now that I look more closely I see that, despite appearances, <strong>the actual lists of files are almost entirely different</strong>.  For the Trusty release, <code>releases</code> serves <code>i386</code> and <code>amd64</code> images, whilst the <code>cdimage</code> site serves PowerPC and Mac-friendly images.  Even going back to the Precise release, when the architectures overlapped more, there are still installer images on each page that are not available from the other.</p>\n\n<p>I've searched for explanations as to why the two sites are so disjoint, but have so far found none.  </p>\n\n<p>I assume that <code>releases.ubuntu.com</code> is intended to hold the more common installer images, whilst <code>cdimage.ubuntu.com</code> is intended to be a more comprehensive archive, given that it also hosts installers for the various spins such as Lubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, this still doesn't explain some things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Why is there no single page I can go to and see all available images?</strong>  For example, if <code>releases.ubuntu.com</code> is reserved for the more popular images, why are these not also included in the (more comprehensive) list at <code>cdimage.ubuntu.com</code>?</p></li>\n<li><p>If there's a good reason for keeping them separate, then <strong>why does neither page acknowledge the other as a complementary source of installer images?</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Is there any historical reason for this split?</strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If anyone has any behind-the-scenes insight into this, I'd be interested to hear how things ended up this way.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":595041,"title":"What&#39;s the difference between the two &quot;Desktop Image&quot; sections on the 14.04 releases page?","body":"<p>At <a href=\"http://ubuntu-releases.wallawalla.edu/14.04/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this mirror of releases.ubuntu.com</a>, there are two sections for \"Desktop Image\" that are very similar:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A. Upper \"Desktop image\" Section</strong></p>\n\n<p>The desktop image allows you to try Ubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later.
