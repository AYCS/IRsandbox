After more playing around with it, I get a 1/20th chance of it actually doing this process then showing the login menu. I am just wondering before I try reinstalling, has anyone else had issues with this? It is completely random and when I try to restart usually it doesn't work.

After testing everything such as my wireless card being compatible I went ahead and installed it. Finally after installing it prompted me to restart which I did. Shortly after I had my default Asus Motherboard logo with BIOs instructions, then it switched to pink for probably 15 seconds without any words. It quickly changed to black for 5 seconds then my Asus monitor automatically turned off not sensing any OS running. But something wasn't normal, it wouldn't go into that phase where it shows a blue screen and then show an orange light showing inactive-ness. It would instead the blue screen with blue and words along the line of \"HDMI not detected\". I know it's not a hardwear failure because before I had Windows installed and did not have this issue. Am I just supported to wait or what? Sorry if I made you cringe with my lack of knowledge, but I am not sure what else to do. If anyone was wondering, yes I tried to go into my BIOs, restarting, and nothing worked. My motherboard is an Asus M5A97 LE R2.0. If you need any other information let me know.
