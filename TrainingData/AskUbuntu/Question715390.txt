[{"id":715390,"title":"Ubuntu Installation Issues - ACPI PCC Probe Failed","body":"<p>Currently I wish to set up a dual boot configuration with Windows 10 as main and Ubuntu as my secondary OS. However, every time I try booting from the bootable Ubuntu USB (Corsair Voyager 32GB) I get the following error: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/tpKT1pY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/tpKT1pY.jpg</a>\nThe same error happens on both the LTS version and the 15.10 version of Ubuntu. The USB boot has also been tested working on 2 other PCs (Not ASUS motherboards), which leads me to believe the issue is caused by not having any onboard or CPU graphics, but only dedicated GPU (GTX 980 Ti).</p>\n\n<p>The error occurs right after pressing the \"Install Ubuntu\" option, and pressing any keys on the keyboard doesn't advance or provoke anything. It's just frozen.\nIt's also worth noting that pressing the <code>\"Try Ubuntu without installing\"</code> option also triggers this error. So I'm not even able to boot on a pre-installed Ubuntu USB.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone got any ideas to what this could be?
