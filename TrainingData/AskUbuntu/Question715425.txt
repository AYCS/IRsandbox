For example, fonts on all the dialogue boxes change, the colors of the tile bars change, etc. It gives me a warning for some kind of system error, but it won't tell me anything about it, and submitting it can't to much given that my internet also doesn't seem to be working. I have tried rebooting, and even using earlier versions of Ubuntu. It doesn't help. Also, there doesn't seem to be any way to turn off the computer through the menus. If I click the icon in the corner and select shut down, it asks me whether I want to lock or log off. If I log off, there's a button to shutdown, which brings up a box asking if I want to shutdown with no buttons.</p>\n"},{"id":115349,"title":"Why does my cursor jump when typing?","body":"<p>When typing in Ubuntu my cursor jumps around and its not application specific.
