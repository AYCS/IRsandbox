I have used Linux already, but that was some years ago and it was a really ugly distro made for schools, so I thought that Linux was s*** and just stuck to Windows. A few days ago I found out about Ubuntu, and decided I would give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>Since my computer DVD port won't open, I decided to use a USB drive. My first try was using Universal USB Installer. The process went fairly quickly in this old 2006 PC and I thought I would just plug it in, choose USB-HDD as boot and everything would work fine. Unfortunately, I got an error saying that something called syslinux was missing, so I just restarted the computer, booted into Windows XP and did some research. </p>\n\n<p>I used WinMD5Sum on my .iso and it was OK. I tried renaming isolinux, isolinux.bin and isolinux.cfg to syslinux, syslinux.bin and syslinux.cfg, but still no luck. So I thought my computer just wouldn't boot from FAT32, and since it was not formatting things properly, I used my cousin's Windows 8.1 machine, but I soon found out I couldn't format in FAT16, because the pendrive is 8GB. So I formatted it in NTFS because someone said it worked. </p>\n\n<p>I then did the process again with Universal USB Installer, but now, instead of giving me the syslinux error, it just booted straight to Windows, even if I choose USB-HDD. Then I tried UNetbootin and same problem. As I type this in, I'm doing the process one more time in FAT32 now using Universal USB Installer, because at least that gave me some sign of life. Please, anyone that has some experience with Ubuntu, help me. I have to quickly get rid of the Windows XP in this machine because it's so full of crap, it's even scary to use.</p>\n"},{"id":638492,"title":"USB bootable Pendrive for Laptop Windows &amp; Ubuntu","body":"<p><strong>Context:</strong>\nLaptop with a CORRUPT ubuntu 12.04 Partition and a corrupt Windows 7.</p>\n\n<p>Corrupt on the ubuntu partition was caused by accidently suspending the laptop during an operating system update to 14.04</p>\n\n<p><strong>Task:</strong>\nI need to repair my ubuntu partition.

I normally run preinstalled windows 8.1 on my Lenovo IdeaPad P400 touch, and I decided to try out dual booting Ubuntu 14.04, having never used Linux before. I edited the UEFI to disable Secureboot (and I think Fastboot) allow Legacy support,  (this was the only way to get UEFI to recognise my LiveUSB, which I made with YUMI <a href=\"http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/</a> on Windows 8.1) and modified the boot priority to boot USB and Optical drive before my HDD. I managed to access Ubuntu on the LiveUSB, and even install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1 without a hitch. Ubuntu runs just fine, and I can even choose between Ubuntu and Windows 8 on GRUB, but Windows 8 now returns a boot error in both normal startup in recovery mode. And now, I cannot get the computer to recognize my LiveUSB (freshly made from the same .iso I used with YUMI, created through Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator). </p>\n\n<p>I do have a backup of all my files and even a system image (created with W8 built in tools) on an external HDD. I also have access to an older Windows XP Desktop, and am fairly confident in my ability to take apart my laptop, if necessary (although admittedly I have only done this with a desktop). </p>\n\n<p>I suspect that what happened to kill my W8 install is that I installed Ubuntu on the same partition that W8 exsists on, rather than the partition I had created with Windows Disk Manager, although I have no experience with Linux or dual booting, so I may be way off base.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for recovering my Windows 8 install? At this point, I would just like to have Windows 8 back and running properly, with or without Ubuntu. I do have my W8.1 product key (taken from a product key extraction program, Belarc, I believe), and I can reinstall all of my important programs if I have to start over. </p>\n"},{"id":592329,"title":"Can I create a USB stick that has a permanent Ubuntu install with other bootable ISOs?","body":"<p>Essentially I have a 32GB USB stick, and what I want to create (in an ideal world) is a stick that will contain :</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A permanent install of Ubuntu (not the 'Try Ubuntu', as I want to\nsave drivers, applications, etc. to use each time).</li>\n<li>A few other bootable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISO images</a> (Windows&nbsp;8 install disk,\nAntivirus tools, System tools, etc.).</li>\n<li>And finally, have a separate space for general file storage.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>-I have seen guides on how to create a proper install of Ubuntu on a USB device, so I can do that, but then I can't have my bootable ISO images on the same stick.</p>\n\n<p>-I know about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_to_create_Live_USB_systems#Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Your Universal Multiboot Installer</a> (YUMI) Multiboot, which I haven't tried, but I believe I can use to install multiple bootable ISO images on the same USB stick, however this would only provide the 'Try Ubuntu' version of Ubuntu, so I would have to redownload applications, etc. every time I use it.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sort of trying to <strong>create an incredibly multi-purpose USB stick for all eventualities.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><em>Are my dreams possible?</em></p>\n\n<p>I've had a search through google and the forum, and I can find answers to pieces of my puzzle, but not how to do it all together.</p>\n\n<p>Could I partition my USB stick into <em>three or four partitions</em> and</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do a full install of Ubuntu on one partition</li>\n<li>Use YUMI to put all the bootable ISO images on a second partition</li>\n<li>Use a third partition for general file storage?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Would that work?\nCan I have two separate bootable partitions on a usb with YUMI on one of them?
