Also, it occasionally appeared to have trouble resolving DNS.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I connected the system in question directly to another host and assigned static IPs. Surprisingly, I got 100% success over 1,000+ pings. My next step was to bypass local router and switch and to connect Xubuntu system directly to the internet. Again, between 20th to 30th ping, packets started dropping out.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to try and spoof my MAC address and - lo and behold - I was able to sustain continuous ping both to the ISP's default gateway and to other hosts on the internet. I do not know if that has solved the problem, but just wanted to post an update. Still testing at this point. If anyone has any ideas please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>ORIGINAL QUESTION: Up until a few days ago, my Xubuntu 14.04 worked just fine. Then I installed security updates and ethernet connection became problematic. It would initially connect just fine, but when doing a continuous ping to, let's say, google I got a staggering 20-70% packet loss. Likewise, browsing would either fail or took a long time to load any page. (Meanwhile, wifi connection still worked flawlessly.)</p>\n\n<p>Google suggested this had to do with the NIC driver (r8169), so I downloaded and installed r8168 but the issue remained the same. Unable to find a viable solution, I restored a partition image prior to the update; apparently, it is now plagued with the same problem.</p>\n\n<p>After further research, I ran <code>ethtool</code> and, sure enough, it showed that the NIC starts off in full-duplex mode, but defaults to half-duplex mode shortly after I start pinging. Forcing full-duplex and disabling auto-negotiation does not solve the issue. I had no success disabling IPv6, either.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I can say for sure - it is definitely NOT a hardware problem, because WIN7 gets a solid connection on the same NIC (the machine is dual-boot). Neither is it network related, because all other hosts on the same network get 100% connection as well. I even tried running a Xubuntu live CD but to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>Can somebody please help me figure this out?</p>\n"},{"id":667167,"title":"Lubuntu doesn&#39;t see Ethernet and Wireless connection on Dell 1300 Inspiron","body":"<p>I just installed Lubuntu on Dell 1300.

I can't get any networking at all unless I plug the ethernet cable into the computer when I boot up. Being a laptop, I can't use it outside my own home (unless there is an ethernet cable to plug into) because of this. Can someone help me fix this?</p>\n\n<p>The info I have to offer so far is this:</p>\n\n<p>When the computer boots up there is some text that rolls by during the boot process (initial screen) telling you what's going on with the boot process.</p>\n\n<p>If I leave the ethernet cable unplugged and allow it to boot that way I will see a message that says it's waiting for network configuration. A while after that, it will say it's going to wait up to another 60 seconds for network configuration. After what seems like several minutes it will boot into the operating system but there will be no network service running at all (no networking).</p>\n\n<p>If I plug the ethernet cable in before or very quickly while booting it will boot normally, it will detect my wireless connection here at home (which happens to be a hidden connection), I can then unplug the ethernet cable and use my computer normally.</p>\n\n<p>It is the same if I boot the computer at a friend's house. If the cable is plugged in it will boot normally and pick up their wireless connection and connect to it, if I don't plug in the cable it will do as described above for that scenario.</p>\n\n<p>I am using network manager.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone can help I would sure appreciate this. I am about to move to a new location in two weeks and will have to transfer my internet service there. Until it is set up at that location I would be unable to connect to the internet. I take online courses at a nearby university and classes start on Aug 28th (so I'll have to be able to get on the internet somehow). I would go to mcdonalds or burger king or some coffee shop to use their connection but would not be able to connect there anyway since they would not have an ethernet cable they could let me plug into. Please, if anyone is able, help me to get this solved before my classes start again.</p>\n\n<p>Output of \"less syslog | grep etwork | pastebinit is available here: <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/1141667/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/1141667/</a></p>\n\n<p>Thank you\nJake</p>\n"}]}]
