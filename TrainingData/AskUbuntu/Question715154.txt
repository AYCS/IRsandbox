[{"id":715154,"title":"Wired network cannot be established, wireless works","body":"<p>I have a dual-boot of Ubuntu 14.10 and Windows 10.</p>\n\n<p>No networking issues are present after booting to Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I boot into Ubuntu, however, I cannot connect even to my router (ZTE ZXDSL 931VII). DHCP seems not to grab an IP (I never get an ipv4 address and ipv6 only gets the MAC-based autoconfigured one), although tcpdump does list some (I assume outgoing) ARP and other UDP packets.</p>\n\n<p>Previously the wired connection was working, however since I didn't boot for a few months, I'm not sure when this issue started. I assume it's probably due to some updates. :-/</p>\n\n<p>Wireless connection, btw, does work without any extra configuration.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried several things which did not fix the problem (top to bottom):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rebooting</li>\n<li>ifconfig eth0 up and down</li>\n<li>Configuring DNS servers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4</li>\n<li>Reconfiguring DHCP (dhclient.conf)</li>\n<li>Specifying variations of auto eth0 and iface eth0 inet[6] dhcp in /etc/network/interfaces (ended up rendering the eth0 iface unmanaged)</li>\n<li>Changing my hostname</li>\n<li>Manually setting up a static ipv4 address</li>\n<li>Disabling ipv4, enabling ipv6 and vice versa</li>\n<li>Removing docker interfaces</li>\n<li>Various other settings through the network manager GUI</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, everything looks normal from the configuration standpoint and I feel that I've pretty much exhausted my attempts to repair this.</p>\n\n<p>As I see it, no IP connectivity is achieved whatsoever.

Maybe i can set my ubuntu connection exactly as I have on WIndows, so the server won't deny my connection? (I noted that in the ifconf I just sent you, here on ubuntu I have the same IP address than yesterday when I was on windows)</p>\n\n<p>But anyway, yesterday I tried using the same IP addresses, submask, gateway and DNS IP numbers, and the signal for \"online\" popped up on my Ubuntu, but no internet was available whatsoever..
