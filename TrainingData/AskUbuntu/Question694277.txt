The ability to customise Ubuntu to meet your specific\n  needs is one of the great strengths of free software in general, and\n  Ubuntu in particular. While we encourage customisation and derivation\n  of Ubuntu, we must balance that freedom with the integrity of the\n  Trademarks and the quality which they represent. To help reach that\n  balance, we have established the following guidelines and definitions.\n  We recognise and encourage the concept of a “remix.” Remixes are\n  derived versions of Ubuntu, and it is intended that any software and\n  hardware certifications will apply to a Remix. Therefore the changes\n  from the official Ubuntu product must be minimal to be permitted to\n  use the Trademarks. These changes can include configuration changes\n  through the existing Ubuntu configuration management tools, changes to\n  artwork and graphical themes and some variance in package selection.\n  In general, a Remix can have applications from the Ubuntu archives\n  added, or default applications removed, but removing or changing any\n  infrastructure components (e.g., shared libraries or desktop\n  components) will result in changes too large for the resulting product\n  to be called by a Trademark. Note that if the nature of the product's\n  divergence from Ubuntu changes, the Remix naming and Trademark use may\n  no longer apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"id":18142,"title":"Lubuntu as an official derivative of Ubuntu","body":"<p>The four main desktop environments are GNOME, KDE, XFCE and LXDE.
