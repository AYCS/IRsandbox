It might well have coincided with a software update but at the time I thought maybe the USB HDD was at fault and didn't make a note of any software changes.</p>\n\n<p>I have since used other USB HDDs and see the same issue. I have also upgraded to 13.04 and the problem remains.</p>\n\n<p>The details of my machine are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>lscpi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor\n  Family DRAM Controller (rev 09)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation\n  Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200\n  Series Chipset Family MEI Controller #1 (rev 04)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1a.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset\n  Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #2 (rev 05)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset\n  Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 05)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset\n  Family PCI Express Root Port 1 (rev b5)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset\n  Family PCI Express Root Port 2 (rev b5)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1c.2 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset\n  Family PCI Express Root Port 3 (rev b5)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1d.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset\n  Family USB Enhanced Host Controller #1 (rev 05)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation HM65 Express Chipset Family LPC\n  Controller (rev 05)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series\n  Chipset Family 6 port SATA AHCI Controller (rev 05)</p>\n  \n  <p>00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family\n  SMBus Controller (rev 05)</p>\n  \n  <p>05:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n  RTL8101E/RTL8102E PCI Express Fast Ethernet controller (rev 05)</p>\n  \n  <p>06:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

Potentially this is the source of the problem , i.e. one USB is USB 1 whereas the rest are USB 2? Subjectively, luckybackup does seem to run a lot quicker when I plug the USB HDD in any othe USB port than the one that dmesg is reporting as 1-1.2</p>\n"},{"id":235942,"title":"Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 fails to boot after usb 1-1.4","body":"<p>I'd like to first apologize for my lack of detail in the information as I'm new to Linux and I'd be happy to provide more if you point me in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>I've tried both 12.04 and 12.10 and both have had issues booting. </p>\n\n<p>In 12.04 I couldn't reboot. A reboot would cause a hang and after the system hanging repeated times, it would start working again. When I would boot up in \"regular mode\", it would hang at a purple screen. I then tried recover mode which would hang at \"fb: conflicting fb hw usage inteldrmfb vs EFI VGA - removing generic driver\". I found an article recommending removing \"gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\" from the normal boot entry but it wasn't present. Then I removed the quiet splash from the normal boot and found that after \"usb 1-1.4: new full-speed USB device number 4 using ehci_hcd\" the system would hang. Then I would get \"INFO: task swapper/0:1 blocked for more than 120 seconds\" with some hex details and a verbose output. </p>\n\n<p>I was advised to upgrade to 12.10 to avoid any potential issues although I wanted to run 12.04 for the LTS side of things. I did a full fresh install of 12.10 and not an upgrade. With 12.10, I have rebooted a few times without issue. I then tried to perform a shutdown which seemed fine until I tried to boot back up and again found I was having issues. The only difference I've found in 12.10 is that now it hangs after the following:</p>\n\n<p>usb 1-1.4: new full-speed USB device number 4 using ehci_hcd\nusb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0489, idProduct=e042\nusb 1-1.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3\nusb 1-1.4: Product: BCM20702A0\nusb 1-1.4: Manufacturer: Broadcom Corp</p>\n\n<p>And then in hangs again at task swapper. </p>\n\n<p>For HW this is a new Lenovo Z480 and any help you could provide would be well appreciated. Thanks! </p>\n"}]}]
