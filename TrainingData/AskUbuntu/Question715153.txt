I found some information using google where people talked about internal firmware and stuff. So i formatted the drive to ext4 which didn't help , now it's formatted NTFS and again it isnt found. My Windows machine has no problem detecting it whatsoever.. The purpose of the drive is to contain my DATA to share over my home network (samba/apache/ftp) the OS itself is running on a microSD card. Can anyone please help me , i can't seem to find any decent/working answers on the web.\n<br>\n<em>Edit:</em> <br>\nI'm pretty sure it's not a powerissue, at first i tried it connected to the usb ports of the pi itself where the hdd had clicking sounds which means it didn't have enough power , so i bought myself a powered usb hub and the drive doesn't make this sound again and it sounds fine.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":322145,"title":"How can I force a format of an external HDD that Gparted and Disk Utility can&#39;t see?","body":"<p>My Seagate  500 GB external HDD stopped working few days ago for unknown reasons.
