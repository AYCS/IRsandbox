[{"id":715795,"title":"Unable to boot into Ubuntu 15.10/Windows 10","body":"<p>I have been running Ubuntu 15.10 on my PC alongside windows 10 for about a month now. I am not a complete beginner but my knowledge is very limited. For the past 3 days I am unable to boot into Ubuntu or windows. Instead of the usual grub menu I get an error message saying no boot device was recognized on restarting the computer. Restarting it a few times might bring up the grub menu eventually but when trying to boot into ubuntu or windows it just gets stuck on a black/purple screen. I was able to boot into windows once after waiting for about an hour for it to load but the system was just so slow it was unusable. I tried booting ubuntu from a live CD and trying many fixes I could find online but none of them worked. I ran boot-repair a few times, although the settings seems to be right and the program reported it successfully completed its task the problem still exists. I tried manually forcing a new installation of grub2 to my efi partition and it didnt work either. At this point I have no idea what to do.</p>\n\n<p>I think it's also worth mentioning I have experienced something similar a month or two ago. Back then I was only running windows. I woke up to a screen saying no boot device was recognized. I had to restart the pc a few times before windows could even load. And when it does it was just slow as hell. I ended up reinstalling the system and a few days later installing Ubuntu as well. Before installing Ubuntu I had to convert my partitions to GPT and change windows to boot on UEFI mode since for some weird reason I was unable to load ubuntu from a live CD on legacy mode. I used this <a href=\"http://social.technet.microsoft.com/...n-to-uefi.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/...n-to-uefi.aspx</a> tutorial and everything went well.
