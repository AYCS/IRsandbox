I installed two packages: <em>nvidia-common</em> and <em>nvidia-modprobe</em>, updating all installed packages in the process. I also ran <code>nvidia-xconfig</code> which created a xorg.conf in my /etc/X11/ folder. Finally I added <code>quiet splash nomodeset</code> to my grub.cfg (as opposed to adding them in the grub menu at each boot). After rebooting, I was able to watch videos in HD. I then deleted the xorg.conf and also purged the two packages I had just installed, and it still works.
