Ideally I want Ubuntu Minimal, but if that refuses to work altogether, I'd settle with a close equivalent. I see two paths to it: either get the network connection working with the installer, or acquire an offline installer and then get the network working after the OS has been installed.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I noticed the problem only manifested if I rebooted straight from Windows to Linux by using the \"restart\" feature of Windows. If I shut down the machine completely first and then booted up to Linux, the network worked fine. This clue lead me to a solution, see the answer I posted myself.</p>\n\n<p>I only have a vague idea of what I'm doing. That's why I'll be a bit more detailed than would be necessary if I had the knowledge to extract only the necessary information of what's wrong.</p>\n\n<p>When I try to install Ubuntu Minimal or Server from an USB drive, the installation fails to \"bad archive mirror\" error when it tries to download something it apparently needs for the installation. When I tried to diagnose it further, it seems the installer cannot connect to Internet. I'm trying to do the installation on a machine where there already is Windows 7 installed, and the network works just fine on the Windows.</p>\n\n<p>During the installation, before the bad archive mirror error, there is a network configuration phase. During this phase, the following steps occur:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Detecting link on em1: please wait...\". Seems to complete just fine, rather quickly.</li>\n<li>\"Waiting for link-local address...\" completes so fast I can barely read the text.</li>\n<li>\"Attempting IPV6 autoconfiguration...\" completes without error after 15 or so seconds.</li>\n<li>\"Configuring the network with DHCP\" fails after 30 seconds of trying. The error message includes \"Your network is probably not using DHCP protocol\". My network is using it, with Inteno X5668 modem acting as the DHCP server. As mentioned, it works when using the installed Windows.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The installer then offers me the option to manually configure the network settings. At this point, before the manual configuration steps, I can open the terminal. The command \"ip a\" results in following output: (I don't have good grasp of what the output means or what the command does. I came accross the command when searching for a solution for the problem.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue\n     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n     inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n     inet6 ::1/128 scope host\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: em1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000\n     link/ether [NETWORK ADAPTER MAC ADDRESS HERE] brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Pinging anything else but 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 at this stage results in \"sendto: network is unreachable\" message, including pinging the router.</p>\n\n<p>Other common troubleshooting commands I am aware of I don't have access to during the installation (eg. ifconfig).</p>\n\n<p>If I select to \"not configure network now\" and proceed with the installation, the installation halts a few steps later with the \"bad mirror archive\" error.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to select manual network configuration, in which case I get to enter IP address, subnet mask, gateway address and DNS address manually. I entered the same values for these that the Windows 7 on the same machine is using, including the address of the router as gateway and DNS. These values include 192.168.1.1 for the router, and 192.168.1.2 for the machine the OS is being installed on. After inputting these, the \"Detecting link on em1\" step occurs again. This time I suspect it's failing, as the progress bar stays at 0% for a good while, until the screen suddenly goes blank for a moment and then the next step of the installation appears.</p>\n\n<p>After the manual configuration, the output of the \"ip a\" command is the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue\n     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00\n     inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n     inet6 ::1/128 scope host\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n2: em1: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000\n     link/ether [NETWORK ADAPTER MAC ADDRESS HERE] brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n     inet 192.168.1.2/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global em1\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n     inet6 fe80::468a:5bff:fea0:5e00/64 scope link\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ping commands at this point don't output an error message, but result in 100% packet loss. This includes pinging the router.</p>\n\n<p>After this, proceeding with the installation again stops soon with the \"bad archive mirror\" error.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried both normal and command line install from 'Ubuntu 14.04 \"Trusty Tahr\" Minimal CD' from <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\" rel=\"nofollow\">the minimal CD wiki page</a> under the '64-bit PC (amd64, x86_64)' section, and command line install from Ubuntu server image 'ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso'. I've tried using both Linux Live USB Creator and UNetbootin for creating the USB installation media I'm installing from. They all behave the same way.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried rebooting the router. It did not change anything. When I rebooted it, the installer was already running, but in an earlier step before the network configuration phase.</p>\n\n<p>I've been trying to find an offline installer, so that the lack of network connection would not be a problem during installation and I could troubleshoot it after the OS has been installed, but I haven't been able to find one for the configuration I want. The installers I tried seem to need to download some files during the installation process. I don't want the regular desktop install of Ubuntu. My original intention was to install the Minimal installation. I then tried the Server one in the hopes I could install that offline, but that does not seem to be the case. Even if such installer exists, I will probably still need help resolving the problem with the installed OS.</p>\n\n<p>The machine has MSI MPower Z97 motherboard, which has integrated Intel I218-V network adapter. Perhaps the driver the installer is using does not work properly with the I218-V? I found out some other users had problems with this network controller until they manually installed some non-default driver, but that was after they successfully completed the installation. Would it be possible for me to mod the ISO so that it uses a different driver during the installation?</p>\n\n<p>The Windows 7 that is already present on the machine has been installed in and is presently booting with UEFI mode.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"id":645268,"title":"What do I type in a terminal to understand what commands mean?","body":"<p>Is there a shortcut key to list what each Help command in the Gnome Terminal means?

Here's why:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For non-/ partitions, it <strong>always</strong> uses <code>&lt;driveroot&gt;/.Trash-&lt;uid&gt;</code>, It <strong>never</strong> used <code>&lt;driveroot&gt;/.Trash/&lt;uid&gt;</code>, even when i created it in advance. While this works, it's annoying: if I have 15 users, I end up with 15 <code>/.Trash-xxx</code> folders in my drive, while the other approach would still give a single folder (with 15 sub-folders). That \"pollution\" in my drives is very unpleasant. And specs say \"<em>If an <code>$topdir/.Trash</code> directory is absent, an <code>$topdir/.Trash-$uid</code> directory is to be used</em>\". Well, it is present, so why does it never use it?</p></li>\n<li><p>root trash does <strong>not</strong> work, at least not out of the box. Open nautilus as root and click on trash; it gives an error. Try to delete any file, it says \"it can't move to trash\". Ok, I know this can be fixed by creating <code>/root/.local/share</code>. But specs says \"<em>A “home trash” directory SHOULD be automatically created for any new user. If this directory is needed for a trashing operation but does not exist, the implementation SHOULD automatically create it, without any warnings or delays.</em>\". Why the error then? Bug?</p></li>\n<li><p>Why must I change <code>/etc/fstab</code> entries for mounted volumes, adding options like uid and guid, if the volumes are already mounted as RW for everyone? </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just some examples of deviation from the standard. So, the question is:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"If Ubuntu does not adhere 100% to the spec, HOW <em>exactly</em> does the trash work? WHERE can i find a technical reference for Ubuntu's implementation of the trash?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>By the way: if Ubuntu does happen to follow specs, please tell me what I am doing wrong, especially regarding the <code>/.Trash-&lt;uid&gt;</code> vs <code>/.Trash/&lt;uid&gt;</code> issue.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some more info:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If a given fs has no support for the sticky bit (VFAT, NTFS), it probably doesn't have for permissions either (at least VFAT surely doesn't). So what prevents one user from purging <code>/</code> restoring other users' <code>./Trash-xxx</code> ? If one can read/write his own Trash, one can do the same for the whole drive, including other's trashes, correct? Or does Gnome have some kind of \"extra\" protection on <code>./Trash-xxx</code> folders on VFAT/NTFS fs?</p></li>\n<li><p>If Linux can \"emulate\" file permissions on NTFS mounting by editing <code>/fstab</code> uid and gid options, can it also \"emulate\" the sticky bit? I would really prefer to use <code>/.Trash/xxx</code> format...</p></li>\n<li><p>For the root issue: for the / partition, I can use trash as root, and it goes to <code>/root/.local/share/Trash</code>. But if I click on Nautilus \"Trash\" (as root), I get an error. Don't you? So files are correctly trashed, but I can't access it. All I can do is manually \"purge\" them  (by deleting files on <code>/root/.local/share/Trash</code>), but restoring would be very tricky (opening info files and manually moving, etc.).</p></li>\n<li><p>For non-/ partitions (or at least for VFAT/NTFS), I can not even use trash as root: it does not create a <code>./Trash-0</code> folder, it simply says \"Cannot trash, want to permanently delete?\" Why?</p></li>\n<li><p>About fstab: i use it for a permanent mount for my NTFS partitions. I have several, and if not \"pre-mounted\" they really clutter the desktop and/or Nautilus. I'd rather have it pre-mounted, integrated in my file system, in mounts like <code>/data</code> , <code>/windows/xp</code> , <code>/windows/vista</code> , and so on, and leave <code>/media</code> and its \"mount/unmount\" flexibility just for truly removable drives.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, if Ubuntu/Gnome truly follows the spec, is there any way to fix the root issues and to \"emulate\" the sticky bit for (at least) my fstab'ed NTFS fixed partitions?</p>\n"},{"id":220589,"title":"Where can I find a PDF of the documentation for Ubuntu?","body":"<p>Is there a FULL PDF manual on the Ubuntu Operating Software that can be printed as oppose to reading on the internet?
