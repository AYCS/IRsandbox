Anyhow, I started off with a 64-Bit Windows 7 platform and I wanted something new then the same boring windows, I heard about Ubuntu before but I didn't see a reason to change it. Now I had found my reason, so what did I do was do the installation via an USB, I went \"try out before installation\" first and it worked perfectly, however... When I installed it, deleted my Window 7 and tried to reboot with my fresh oh-so-clean new OS, it didn't want to load. At a certain point it said to boot up from a bootable option or something like that. Where it came to was that I couldn't load it up. Now, I wanted to switch back to Windows 7 because it didn't work and now I can't switch back because my harddrive switched modus because of Linux files (From NTFS to 4ex or something, I forgot). I'm currently typing this in the try out version of Ubuntu since I can't switch back to either Windows 7 or to the installed version of Ubuntu. So, my question follows: Can I fix it by keeping Ubuntu?
