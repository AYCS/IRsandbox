(Model identifier: MacBook7,1 . I have upgraded my RAM from 2GB to 8GB, if that matters.) I have the proprietary NVIDIA drivers installed on my Kubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>Judging from the temperature monitor widget in Kubuntu, my temperature seems to be ~10℃ hotter compared to under Mac OS X. In Mac OS X I use <a href=\"http://www.bresink.com/osx/TemperatureMonitor.html\">Temperature Monitor</a>. I'm comparing the CPU Core 0 and CPU Core 1 values in Kubuntu to the CPU Core 1 and CPU Core 2 values in Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p>10℃ more may be not a very big overheating disaster, but when I do really intense things on my computer (such as playing <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/440\">Team Fortress 2</a> a while) my CPU is at ~70℃ on OSX, and when playing it a while on Kubuntu, my CPU is ~80℃. I worry that the higher temperature may shorten the lifetime of my laptop.</p>\n\n<p>I did some research and found out that it may be that I installed it in BIOS mode, which causes the heat. I can't install it in EFI mode, because the propietary NVidia drivers don't work then (already tried that, it gave a black screen). Does anyone know how to get the propietary NVidia drivers work in EFI mode?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Ok, even if there isn't a way to use the proprietary nvidia drivers in EFI mode (doesn't seem like there is a way to do it, I'm not getting any answers), I would already be happy if the heating could be fixed in BIOS mode. How can I at least fix the heating in BIOS mode?\nI tried putting this in my xorg.conf in the Device section to enable power saving:</p>\n\n<pre><code>     Option         \"DPMS\" \"1\"\n     Option         \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1; PowerMizerEnable=0x1; PerfLevelSrc=0x2233; PowerMizerDefault=0x3\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...but that didn't work.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and I'm not using rEFIt by the way, could it be that?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":542007,"title":"Ubuntu 14.10 on MacBookPro4,1 nVidia 8600m - cannot load binary drivers","body":"<p>I am switching from MacOS to Xubuntu after endless issues trying to extend the useful life of my treasured A1260 MacBook Pro (issues including USB3.0, NTFS, iTunes, App Store, quite a few).

I have tried the packaged 331 and the latest self-contained from nVidia; neither worked.  </p>\n\n<p>I have installed rEFInd but that has not helped; in fact, it will only boot if I select the EFI option. Selecting the second, conventional option just hangs immediately after the rEFInd window. Xubuntu is the only OS on this machine, and I formatted the disk with an msdos partition table.

I have also tried <code>nopat</code> which didn't help.  </p>\n\n<p>My basic understanding is that BIOS Compatibility is not kicking in on the MBP hardware. As Xubuntu is the only OS on it, I have no issues reconfiguring the system until it works, if this is even possible; some searching reveals this is a very tricky issue and nVidia have washed their hands of it.
