(It doesn't actually overwrite the actual command, but visually, it is overwriting the text that was displayed).</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to explain without seeing it, but let's say my terminal was 20 characters wide (Mine is more like 120 characters - but for the sake of an example), and I want to echo the English alphabet.  What I type is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But what my terminal looks like before I hit the  key is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pqrstuvwxyzghijklmno\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I hit enter, it echos</p>\n\n<pre><code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>so I know the command was received properly.  It just wrapped my typing after the \"o\" and started over on the same line.  </p>\n\n<p>What I would expect to happen, if I typed this command in on a terminal that was only 20 characters wide would be this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo abcdefghijklmno\npqrstuvwxyz\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Background: I am using bash as my shell, and I have this line in my ~/.bashrc:</p>\n\n<pre><code>set -o vi\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to be able to navigate the command line with VI commands.  I am currently using Ubuntu 10.10 server, and connecting to the server with Putty.</p>\n\n<p>In any other environment I have worked in, if I type a long command line, it will add a new line underneath the line I am working on when my command gets longer than the terminal width and when I keep typing I can see my command on 2 different lines.  But for as long as I can remember using Ubuntu, my long commands only occupy 1 line.</p>\n\n<p>This also happens when I am going back to previous commands in the history (I hit Esc, then 'K' to go back to previous commands) - when I get to a previous command that was longer than the terminal width, the command line gets mangled and I cannot tell where I am at in the command.</p>\n\n<p>The only work-around I have found to see the entire long command is to hit \"Esc-V\", which opens up the current command in a VI editor.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think I have anything odd in my .bashrc file.  I commented out the \"set -o vi\" line, and I still had the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I downloaded a fresh copy of Putty and didn't make any changes to the configuration - I just typed in my host name to connect, and I still have the problem, so I don't think it's anything with Putty (unless I need to make some config changes)</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else had this problem, and can anyone think of how to fix it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\n\n<p>It was my .bashrc file.  I've copied the same profile from machine to machine, and I used special characters in my $PS1 that are somehow throwing it off.  I'm now sticking with the standard bash variables for my $PS1.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @ændrük for the tip on the .bashrc!</p>\n\n<p><strong>...End Edit...</strong></p>\n"},{"id":657286,"title":"How to prevent commands being removed from history?","body":"<p>I have noticed that when I go up through my commands using the arrow keys, <kbd>UP</kbd> and <kbd>DOWN</kbd>, that if I then edit a command, it edits it in history, and I can even remove a command like that, however I do not want it to have this affect on the commands in history, I don't want it to actually delete them in the history, only allow me to edit what I am typing, but not actually modify the history through this.
