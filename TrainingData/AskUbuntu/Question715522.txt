The solution was just to downgrade. Didn't even need to install the OS for it to work, it worked inside the installer.</p>\n\n<p>My mother's old laptop was running Windows 7. For one reason or another, she decided she didn't want it, so I took it and installed Ubuntu 15.04 on the laptop. Now before I did this, her Wireless Card inside the laptop went out (For one reason or another, we don't know), so we bought a little USB WiFi Adapter. It's a netgear for anyone wondering. The installation went perfect without any hitches, expect the WiFi won't work. Now I'm not saying it's 100% dead, that's anything but true. I can still scan for networks and see them in the network list, but when I try to connect to my hidden network, using WPA2-PSK [AES], it will keep doing the little \"connecting\" animation in the status bar, then after about 10 minutes, stop, and quit trying to connect. Is there anyway I can connect to my Internet? Also, I do NOT have access to Ethernet at the time. I can get access, but it would take me a while. My main goal is to actually be able to use the WiFi Adapter, so I can take the laptop places and connect to WiFi.

I didn't even have the operating system installed and I was able to connect through the installation screen. I guess 15.04 doesn't have the necessary drivers, or they don't support the new kernal.
