[{"id":144690,"title":"cannot make ubuntu 64-bit v12.04 install work","body":"<p>I decided it was time to update my ubuntu (single boot) computer from 64-bit v10.04 to 64-bit v12.04. Unfortunately, for some reason (or reasons) I just can't make it work.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I am attempting a fresh install of 64-bit v12.04 onto a new 3TB hard disk, not an upgrade of the 1TB hard disk that contains my working 64-bit v10.04 installation.  To perform the attempted install of v12.04 I unplug the SATA cable from the 1TB drive and plug it into the 3TB drive (to avoid risking damage to my working v10.04 installation).</p>\n\n<p>I downloaded the ubuntu 64-bit v12.04 install DVD ISO file (~1.6 GB) from the ubuntu releases webpage and burned it onto a DVD.  I have downloaded the DVD ISO file 3 times and burned 3 of these installation DVDs (twice with v10.04 and once with my winxp64 system), but none of them work.  I run the \"check disk\" on the DVDs at the beginning of the installation process to assure the DVD is valid.</p>\n\n<p>When installation completes and the system boots the 3TB drive, it reports \"unknown filesystem\".  After installation on the 250GB drives, the system boots up fine.</p>\n\n<p>During every install I plug the same SATA cable (sda) into only one disk drive (the 3TB or one of the 250GB drives) and leave the other disk drives unconnected (for simplicity).</p>\n\n<p>It is my understanding that 64-bit ubuntu (and 64-bit linux in general) has no problem with 3TB disk drives. In the BIOS I have tried having EFI set to \"enabled\" and \"auto\" with no apparent difference (no success).  I never bothered setting the BIOS to \"non-EFI\".</p>\n\n<p>I have tried partitioning the drive in a few ways to see if that makes a difference, but so far it has not mattered. Typically I manually create partitions something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>8GB  /boot  ext4\n8GB  swap\n3TB  /      ext4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I've also tried the following, just in case it matters:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  8GB  boot   efi\n  8GB  swap\n  8GB  /boot  ext4\n  3TB  /      ext4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note:  In the partition dialog I specify bootup on the same drive I am partitioning and installing ubuntu v12.04 onto.  It is a VERY DANGEROUS FACT that the default for this always comes up with the wrong drive (some other drive, generally the external drive).  Unless I'm stupid or misunderstanding something, this is very wrong and very dangerous default behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Note:  If I connect the SATA cable to the 1TB drive that has been my ubuntu 64-bit v10.04 system drive for the past 2 years, it boots up and runs fine.</p>\n\n<p>I guess there must be a log file somewhere, and maybe it gives some hints as to what the problem is. I should be able to boot off the 1TB drive with the 3TB drive connected as a secondary (non-boot) drive and get the log file, assuming there is one and someone tells me the name (and where to find it if the name is very generic).</p>\n\n<p>After installation on the 3TB drive completes and the system reboots, the following prints out on a black screen:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Loading Operating System ...\nBoot from CD/DVD :\nBoot from CD/DVD :\nerror: unknown filesystem\ngrub rescue&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note:  I have two DVD burners in the system, hence the duplicate line above.</p>\n\n<p>Note:  I install and boot 64-bit ubuntu v12.04 on both of my 250GB in this same system, but still cannot make the 3TB drive boot.</p>\n\n<p>Sigh.

I deleted the following folders from the 10.04 Live USB: .disk,  casper, dists, install, pics, pool, preseed (i.e. everything apart from the isolinux folder).</p>\n\n<p>I then copied all items from the 11.10 folder (so that's everything except for boot, efi and isolinux folders) into the Live USB folder.  Replace any files that have the same name.  </p>\n\n<p>I was then able to boot into the Live USB and into a live Ubuntu 64-bit session.  This method also worked to allow me to get as far as the installation menu in Ubuntu Studio 64-bit.</p>\n\n<p>Word of caution: this method worked to allow me to try a live session.  However, I don't know (because it's beyond my technical understanding) if messing with the .iso image like this will cause problems for an actual installation...</p>\n"}]}]
