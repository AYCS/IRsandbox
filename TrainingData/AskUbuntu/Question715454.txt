In the question, there is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Additional information: The sequence of these mappings is Key,\n  Shift+Key, mode_switch+Key, mode_switch+Shift+Key, AltGr+Key,\n  AltGr+Shift+Key.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I looked at the modifier keys in Xmodmap in order to understand which modifier key is the <code>mode_switch</code> key but did not see any. Then I realized that <code>mode_switch</code> is not a modifier key but it is actually a keysym, along with the <code>Shift</code> and <code>AltGr</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, is there any combination that makes use of, say Mod5?
