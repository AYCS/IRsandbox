I normally run preinstalled windows 8.1 on my Lenovo IdeaPad P400 touch, and I decided to try out dual booting Ubuntu 14.04, having never used Linux before. I edited the UEFI to disable Secureboot (and I think Fastboot) allow Legacy support,  (this was the only way to get UEFI to recognise my LiveUSB, which I made with YUMI <a href=\"http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/</a> on Windows 8.1) and modified the boot priority to boot USB and Optical drive before my HDD. I managed to access Ubuntu on the LiveUSB, and even install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.1 without a hitch. Ubuntu runs just fine, and I can even choose between Ubuntu and Windows 8 on GRUB, but Windows 8 now returns a boot error in both normal startup in recovery mode. And now, I cannot get the computer to recognize my LiveUSB (freshly made from the same .iso I used with YUMI, created through Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator). </p>\n\n<p>I do have a backup of all my files and even a system image (created with W8 built in tools) on an external HDD. I also have access to an older Windows XP Desktop, and am fairly confident in my ability to take apart my laptop, if necessary (although admittedly I have only done this with a desktop). </p>\n\n<p>I suspect that what happened to kill my W8 install is that I installed Ubuntu on the same partition that W8 exsists on, rather than the partition I had created with Windows Disk Manager, although I have no experience with Linux or dual booting, so I may be way off base.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for recovering my Windows 8 install? At this point, I would just like to have Windows 8 back and running properly, with or without Ubuntu. I do have my W8.1 product key (taken from a product key extraction program, Belarc, I believe), and I can reinstall all of my important programs if I have to start over. </p>\n"},{"id":606586,"title":"How can I RE-ENABLE USB boot ...?","body":"<p>I have made a bootable USB.

I've been running it off the USB drive to play with Linux on various machines without a problem.  I recently installed Ubuntu to a hard drive from the USB drive using the USB boot loader's menu option (versus the \"install to hard drive\" option found on the live-USB desktop).  Most everything installed correctly.  However the installer overwrote the boot loader on the USB drive and never installed it on the fixed disk such that I couldn't boot the machine without the USB drive.  I found <a href=\"http://superuser.com/questions/176050/ubuntu-server-installed-from-usb-putsgrub-on-theusb-drive-instead-of-the-hard/176088\">this thread</a> that helped me to correct the fixed disk boot problem.

I'd rather not do this when I imagine all I need to do is restore the pendrivelinux boot menu.  At this point, I'm backing up all the files on the USB drive to another machine and may attempt the repave with the hope that I can somehow restore only the changed/persisted part of the USB drive. (And unfortunately I've run out of usable USB drives on which I could do a fresh install of bootable ubuntu in order to compare that against the messed up one to see what could be restored.)</p>\n"}]}]
