I do have my system on a 5 disk raid5 mdadm array.  My problem is that Google hangouts crashes when I do video streaming (sometimes). </p>\n\n<p>I recently installed Ubuntu server 14.04 with standard Ubuntu desktop.  I used to have Kubuntu 14.04.  I have since wiped the server version of Ubuntu and reinstalled the desktop version but the problem remains.</p>\n\n<p>When I had Kubuntu my webcam (and google hangouts) worked fine without any special driver tweaking (unfortunately I don't remember which Nvidia driver I was using).  Now I have Ubuntu 14.04 and when I try to use Google hangouts with my webcam or screen sharing it crashes after a few minutes.  (Just the window crashes, not the whole computer).  If I keep the webcam turned off and only use the embedded mic it seems to work fine.  Also if I use low quality video it doesn't crash.  However, even if it is in low quality, doing a screen share will cause it to crash.</p>\n\n<p>The crashes occur in both Chrome and Firefox.  I haven't tried other browsers. </p>\n\n<p>Here's my <code>lsusb -v</code> for the webcam <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/LL6S3wUD\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/LL6S3wUD</a> although I think the webcam is a red herring at this point, I'll leave this here in case someone wants to look at it.</p>\n\n<p>I have Nvidia Geforce GTX 650 Ti with Nvidia 340.76 driver and then 352.3 and then the 346.82 driver.  I was using the 340.76 and then the 352.3 drivers while on the server build and on the desktop build I went straight to 346.82 from the GUI because it's the one that said it was tested.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how the (hangouts) crashes unfold:\nThe first thing that happens is I'll stop getting audio and video of the people I'm chatting with.  When I look at my system monitor, one of the CPU cores will go to 100% and the network activity drops to 0.  The Xorg process is what seems to be using up the CPU during this time.  Xorg won't consistently show a high CPU utilization but the CPU core itself will stay at 100% for a minute or two.   After I click through the crash window the processors return to normal usage.</p>\n\n<p>It seems like there's something going on with the window manager but I don't really know what else to try or look at.  I started looking at various logs and I came across a couple things, I don't know if they're related.
