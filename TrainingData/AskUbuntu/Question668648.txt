Please check the Windows documentation about hardware disk configuration and your hardware reference manuals for additional information.\"</p>\n\n<p>So I don't know if there has been an attempt to create another partition for Windows Home that wasn't successful?

This type of thing has happened several time before on the same install. My main question is: How doe you tell if the update or install is actually happening or if it is hung up?
