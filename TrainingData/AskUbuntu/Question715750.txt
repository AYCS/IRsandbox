This device worked great in 13.10 using VLC to stream the video/audio to a file.  In VLC in 13.10 it showed \"video for linux 2\" as an option for the capture device.  In VLC in 14.04, no \"video for linux 2\" shows an option for the capture device.  It seems to register the device to video1, but trying VLC with video1 but no \"video for linux 2\" results in nothing - the VLC \"cone\" remains on the screen.  I blew away my 14.04 install last night and installed 14.04 instead, and in VLC \"video for linux 2\" shows again and when I select video1 it works fine again.</p>\n\n<p>This is a USB device, and I already went through the \"my camera doesn't work in 14.04\" thing.  I know that was because of a new database of devices and a change in udev and mtp(mtd??).  I'm suspecting that the changes to udev is why this device isn't being picked up correctly in 14.04.  In the normal Ubuntu forums nobody replied.  I asked for how to file a bug report, but everything you have to go through to get information together, etc., to actually file a bug report just gets me lost.  I don't even know how to get that information.  Having \"downgraded\" to 12.04 it will be difficult to get the information for 14.04.  It was suggested in the Ubuntu forums that I run 14.04 off a live media and recreate the problem - but again, I don't understand at all what information they need and how the heck I get it.  After feeling lost on launchpad, I clicked on the link there to come here and ask for any form of help.  I can do my best to provide information asked for.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"id":434291,"title":"usb video capture device: video displayed OK but NO sound?","body":"<p>I'm trying to digitize my old Video8 videos with a Terratec GrabsterAV350MX usb device on a Kubuntu system.
