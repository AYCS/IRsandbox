I tried new Ubuntu Mate 15.10 .iso file from official website but it didn't boot (using Unetbootin) then I was suggested to use Diskpart instead. I used diskpart to format the Usb and the copied the contents of iso file into usb. However it didn't boot again. I kept using this .iso file and turned secure boot off, didn't work again. After disabling Hibernation and fast boot I tried again but nothing. At the end I checked usb file contents I thought to myself it lacks some files compared to another iso file (gnome) which I had before, so downloaded one older version Ubuntu mate 15.04 and this time some of missing files were there e.g. boot folder.
