That part all works fine (booting the USB on the PC and trying Ubuntu and/or installing from there on the PC HD.) I have no CD drive on this PC, but I suppose I could get one.  I would rather find some Linux install that works from USB like I've always done.</p>\n\n<p>After running boot-repair twice, in the Asus BIOS I now see three different UEFI boot options in the priority list, and they are all labelled exactly the same:</p>\n\n<p><strong>ubuntu (P6: WDC WD5000AAKX-00U6AA0)</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Then there's a non-UEFI option:</p>\n\n<p><strong>P6: WDC WD5000AAKX-00U6AA0 (476940MB)</strong></p>\n\n<p>And a fifth option appeared after the first boot-repair:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Windows Boot Manager (P6: WDC WD5000AAKX-00U6AA0)</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have tried all 5 of these, and I get exactly the same error.</p>\n\n<p>I have never had Windows installed on this HD.
