Meaning, that I'm not a beginner with configuring <a href=\"https://ubuntu-mate.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ubuntu MATE</a>. I have created a script which I launch with <kbd>META</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>, which first gives me <code>zenity --entry</code> and then does various things regarding on what I input. If I type \"<code>ff hb</code>\" and hit enter, I get Firefox with <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Humble Bundle</a>. I had to create that in response to the lack of equal \"run command\" (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>) to one present in KDE, where I simply need to type <code>kon</code> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open terminal (konsole). Eventually, I like my solution more, because I can expand it as I ever want in limits of bash, distro and installed apps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An example situation</strong><br>\nAs we all know, hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> does not <strong>bold</strong> your text selection in text-editors designed for coding, instead it does whatever your application is defined to do. Geany, by default, jumps between brackets, if you have one near cursor. Pluma does nothing (it seems). Kate, well, I don't remember. You get the idea however.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if I'd want to change things so, that there's a desktop-wide keybinding that launches a certain script. And when Geany is frontmost application, and I hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, some magical things happens. Like, the selected text gets cut (you know, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>), a snippet appears, and the previously selected text appears into the middle of the snippet. I write a lot of code that contains HTML, if not directly editing HTML-document, thus you can easily imagine something like <code>&lt;span class=\"b\"&gt;some text&lt;/span&gt;</code>. This part is NOT the problem - I'm very able to create this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem</strong><br>\nIf I have done desktop-wide keybinding for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, this is where things bite the dust, full mouthful. In LibreOffice, I can't bold text anymore by using shortcut-keys. In Firefox, I can't open bookmark-sidebar with shortcut-keys. Because the desktop-wide keybinding steals the full control of the shortcut, and I don't know how to \"return it\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Question</strong><br>\nHow do I make it so that when a keybinding, like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, launches a script that checks for some conditions, causes the actual default event to happen if required conditions are not met? Is it possible to have condition-based keybindings with Ubuntu?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Epilogue</strong><br>\nNobody should come to tell me that this is completely impossible. I've used <a href=\"http://plumamazing.com/mac/ikey/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iKey</a> on Mac, which was able to produce exactly what I am trying to accomplish on Ubuntu. It <em>may</em> not be possible <em>currently</em>, and if so, it's a great lack. If it actually is possible currently, I'd like a solution that forces me to install as little extra software as possible, and if necessary, then from the repositories.
