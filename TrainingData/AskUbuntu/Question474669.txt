My laptop has a Intel i-3 chip, Nvidia Geforce chip (that appears to be running ok with Bumblebee) and a SSD and HDD. Ubuntu 14.04 is the only OS installed. I have <code>tlp</code>installed. I also have <code>thermald</code> installed with intel-pstate editin the grub file.

The other thing I have noted is that fan never seems to come on in any heavy way which I was expecting but I think it is working in low mode. Fan does not show up in <code>lm-sensors</code>.
