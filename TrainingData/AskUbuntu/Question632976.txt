That's why I have hesitated if to ask it here, on Ask Ubuntu, or somewhere else, let's say, Freelancer or Workspace. But, I have decided in the end, I need technical solutions to my socio-professional problems.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's get to the point. I've been working as an online shop administrator for my former boss. But, till now I was paid only with praises and thanks. When I have explicitly asked for my money, I was asked to give detailed \"proofs\" of my work. Giving the fact that, at the beginning of our collaboration, my ex-boss told me that he knows everything I do online, I find it very weird to be asked right now for \"proofs\". So, I believe now this is only one of his tactics to delay my payment or even to discourage me. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, luckily, I had the inspiration to install Ubuntu One and to synchronise my work folder. So, theoretically, I have most of my \"evidence\" online and I can send him the link to see it. But here is the hard part, and here I need your answer and advice.</p>\n\n<p>I am new in this Linux world and I had a lot of headache to make Ubuntu One work (and I still can't make the right-click menu work all the time). And I am hesitant about sharing my precious work files to a person that might try to erase or alter them. </p>\n\n<p>Giving these facts, here are my worries and questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can I share my folder (and its files and sub-folders) to my former boss in such a way that he cannot alter them?</li>\n<li>Does Ubuntu One show (to the person I share with) the hour and date of the synchronisation (or when I have uploaded the file online)?</li>\n<li>Does Ubuntu One have any bugs related to synchronisation? If so, how can I fix this? I mean that, long after synchronising (or directly uploading) a file/folder, I saw a message in the right-top part of the screen saying something like that \"file blablah.jpg it is uploaded\". How can taht be? I mean, if I synchronise file blablah.jpg on 1 September, how can I see the message about its synchronisation on 5 or 10 or 12 September? Shouldn't it happen instantly? How does it affects the date shown online? I need the read time dates to be shown, in order to convince my boss that my work was real. (And if I can't convince him, I need to convince the authorities if it is necessarily to go my issue further). </li>\n<li>What other security advices can you give me related to Ubuntu One?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please, excuse the complexity of my question, but I really need an answer so I can then answer to my ex-boss. I also intend to continue to use Ubuntu One at work to upload my important files. </p>\n\n<p>If my question is not clear enough, please, do ask me for further details. I look forward for your answers as I think they will be helpful for other newbies too. </p>\n"},{"id":319423,"title":"Why can&#39;t I use my @ubuntu.com mail address to register an Ubuntu One account?","body":"<p>When I try to do so, it tells me:</p>\n\n<p>This email address cannot be used.</p>\n"},{"id":259045,"title":"Ubuntu One stuck at &quot;File Sync Starting&quot; on Lubuntu 12.10","body":"<p>I installed Ubuntu One on my Lubuntu installation, and it's not syncing my files or folders.

But, this has been going for about 24 hours now (not counting the days that I've had it running before).  I've tried installing EVERYTHING that came with \"sudo apt-get install ubuntuone*\" and that didn't fix the issue.  Now, I've uninstalled everything, and installed ubuntuone-control-panel-qt along with it's associated dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>On February 16, I sent an email to UbuntuOne support and haven't received anything back. So I'm asking for suggestions here. I really don't want to have to install ubuntu-desktop--just to get Ubuntu One working.  </p>\n\n<p>One other issue (not related) that I could add is that my hard drive does have occasional Input/Output errors.

Since the addition release of an OS X client, Ubuntu one is starting to look very interesting (for various reasons I use all three platforms).</p>\n\n<p>I have a question, though, concerning the pricing plan. As a freelancer, I've a VAT-number (registered in Sweden), and would like to know if VAT is included in the price. If yes, how do I go about to pull it off? Purchasing goods and services from outside of Sweden, I've noticed at least two ways to handle this, which is why I'm asking. Google for instance adds local tax which I then can pull off in my accounts with the Swedish tax agency. Amazon, on the other hand, asks for my VAT-number, after which they themselves pull the VAT off of my purchases.

I like having my notes accessible across all of my computers, and would like to be able to do the same thing on my phone. I know there is a client for Android, but from what I could tell, no such client exists for iPhone. </p>\n\n<p>I'd been meaning to play around with learning some iPhone development anyway, so I did some reading on iOS development, spent some time, and wrote an application that does most everything that I use Tomboy for. It can link to your Ubuntu One account, sync notes back and forth, and it supports the majority of the formatting (bold, underline, highlight, etc.) options. I'm sure that someone more experienced in iOS development could have done a better job, but it seems to work well enough for what I need.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to put it in the apple app store for free and make the source available (as I'm sure it could stand to be fixed and refined by someone more knowledgeable than myself), but I'm not sure what the rules are for such a thing. Right now I've just got it on my own computers and haven't gone to the trouble to pay to enter the Apple developer program because I have some questions about whether I can do so, before I spend the money.</p>\n\n<p>As it stands right now, I've used the Ubuntu font in the application (font.ubunu.com), as well as some mentions of Ubuntu itself and the Ubuntu One logo. I suspect the use of the font is probably okay, but I have my doubts about the logo, so some rebranding might be necessary. More than that, am I even allowed to access the Ubuntu One Notes service in this way? I know Ubuntu has some mobile applications for syncing other Ubuntu One services (music, contacts, etc.), but I couldn't find mention of notes, and as I said before, I know that Tomboy and Tomdroid are already utilizing Ubuntu One as a sync destination. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, I was hoping someone might either know the answers to some of these questions, or be able to point me toward someone who does. Obviously I can just continue using this application for myself as it does what I wanted, but I thought it might be nice to make it available for other people and, if someone more knowledgeable about iOS development were so inclined, to improve it.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry this was a bit long, and thanks!\nAdam</p>\n"},{"id":56020,"title":"Is Ubuntu One Robust enough for serious use?","body":"<p>First off, this not a whinging moaning message: I'm interested to see if other people have similar problems to the ones I've had, and I'm trying to be constructive.</p>\n\n<p>I am comparing U1 with DropBox.\nI would like to drop the other product due to security issues and problems I have with support, terms of use, etc..\nThe trouble is DropBox is rather good and well, 'just works'</p>\n\n<p>I've been playing with/testing U1 using 4 machines.</p>\n\n<p>In general it works but I have lots of occasional problems.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Conflicts ...

(DropBox client is not installed on any of the 4 test machines ) </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for bearing with me through with this long message!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thank you for your thoughts, I'm comparing U1 to the more established, sync software out there, DropBox and SpiderOak <em>(Thanks Allan, I had already spotted this, but thanks anyway )</em></p>\n\n<p>As I said in the Post DropBox 'just works' and with my admittedly brief encounter with SpiderOak that also 'just Works'. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I'm looking too hard, but for example when a file has been stable for 4 days across all 4 of my test systems ( and on the Web Site ), an edit to the file causes a conflict, I just can't put that into the 'just works' category. </p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to discuss the problems with a positive spin, I don't consider U1 yet to be of 'industrial strength' but I would like it to be and I would be happy to help in any way I can. There is no point in burying our heads in the sand and repeating the Mantra 'UbuntuOne is great', if it isn't. </p>\n\n<p>As an example some people I know, new to this file syncing, just don't trust it and don't use it -- bring out the old USB stick is their response.  Having had this negative attitude now, it will take a lot to bring them around. They had been doing things like editing files in the U1 Directory which as you said is asking for problems, but if no-one tells them they're going to lose faith in the technology, as it doesn't seem to work for them.</p>\n"}]}]
