When I open the dropbox web app, it turns out that the new files/changes in existing files haven't synced to dropbox (web) itself.</p>\n\n<p>I mean - all my code is stored in my dropbox folder itself, on both the ubuntu and mac computers. So there's no need to separately copy-paste files to the dropbox folder. The only way the sync finally works is when I restart the ubuntu computer at least twice. After the restart, the sync appears on both dropbox online, as well as the dropbox folder on the mac. </p>\n\n<p>I've been through this question where the problem is that <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/511486/dropbox-does-not-sync-on-ubuntu-14-04\">Dropbox doesn't sync at all</a>, but mine is different.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, this problem seems to be happening more often on my ubuntu computer ever since Dropbox started popping up the <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/148171/dropbox-error-echo-100000-sudo-tee-proc-sys-fs-inotify-max-user-watches\">\"Dropbox can't monitor the filesystem.

However, the syncing of file changes on the other machines continues as normal, and changes I make on the other machines do get synced onto the Ubuntu machine.  So it's just the changes that I make on Ubuntu that don't seem to be uploaded to the other machines.</p>\n\n<p>After I make changes to a Dropbox file locally on Ubuntu, if  I open the web interface to Dropbox on my ubuntu machine, it seems to be aware of only the older versions of the file before I started my current session of file changes.  If I drop the newer  versions of the file created on Ubuntu into the web page, then it uploads and then all the  machines see my changes. So the Ubuntu machine is really changing the files locally but unlike the other machines where local changes are automatically synced, on the Ubuntu machine this no longer happens.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't done anything to the Ubuntu system other than the normal stream of automatic ubuntu system updates .</p>\n\n<p>This \"failure to sync\" is  a persistent condition, continuing across many days of system power offs and restarts (and further automatic system updates).  I haven't noticed any other unusual behavior or breakage for the other features I use on the machine.  </p>\n\n<p>Do I need to do a reinstall?
