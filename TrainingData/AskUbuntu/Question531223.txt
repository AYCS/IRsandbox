I installed it from my usb and everything went fine. Ubuntu was on my comp and I stupidly spent a few hours personalizing it and installing my favorite programs. Then I restarted the comp. Now, the only way Ubuntu will boot is if the usb is in. Not only that but it goes right back to the bare bones Ubuntu and not my personalized version. Before it boots the same black screen comes up and asks if I want to try Ubuntu or install it and I have to hit either one just to get into the system. If the usb is not in the comp then nothing boots up. Ubuntu should already be installed onto my comp. How do I switch the OS from on the usb to permanently on my hard drive? It is not an issue with boot order. I have already played around and changed order up a few times. </p>\n"},{"id":486057,"title":"Toshiba Satellite P55-A: Cant boot from usb","body":"<p>For a few days now I have been trying to install Ubuntu (also tried Fedora, BackTrack, and Kali) onto an 8GB usb drive.
