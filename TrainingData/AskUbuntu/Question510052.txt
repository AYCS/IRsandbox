This is about playing the piano through the computer. I have an m-audio keystation 88 which is a whole separate machine that connects through the usb cable that I got to work in windows xp with software from cantabile, I do not remember how but it does not matter because linux does not have cantabile. There are a lot of things like Midi and synthesizers and cards and jacks and controls and I do not know how they go together. A while ago I tried to get wine to work but couldn't do it. All the documentation I can find assumes you know almost all of the answer already. I don't presume to ask anyone how to do it but I do need something very simple to at least get me started. </p>\n"},{"id":512704,"title":"After 14.04 update video/totem won&#39;t play midi","body":"<p>Prior to the upgrade, I could be on wikipedia and play the 'play' links fine where totem would open a window and have screen graphics go on.\nNow, after researching, installing VLC and it's extensions, making sure the gnome codec installer is activated, and on and on, all I get is :\n\"The parameters passed to the application had an invalid format.

The problem is that whenever I start JACK I can't play sounds from YouTube, Move Player, RhythmBox, etc. because JACK is taking over the soundcard. </p>\n\n<p>Here's how I start JACK and my MIDI keyboard:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ pulseaudio --kill\n$ jackd &amp; qjackctl &amp; amsynth\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(plug in keyboard)</p>\n\n<p>So, apparently JACK needs the PulseAudio soundcard.
