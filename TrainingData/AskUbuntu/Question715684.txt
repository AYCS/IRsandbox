The Live Disk tryout works OK if a bit slow, and the installation appears to go normally. But when I try to use the system I just installed, it does crazy things. It gets as far as the logon page, then asks for a password even though I configured it on the install for automatic log-on. On 15.10 it displays \"Pete-Ubuntu13.10\" at the top of the page, and at the bottom, \"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\" It seems to be picking up bits and pieces of things from different drives. Clicking on Log on in the Guest session mode dismisses the dialog box and nothing further happens. Using the assigned password brings a \"wrong password\" response, but it will accept a password with the last digit two numbers less than the one I assigned it.
