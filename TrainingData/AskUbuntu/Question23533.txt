Anyone know where i could look or help with the answer. I'm hoping the power of social media will come through…\nI have a need to perform the following action:</p>\n\n<p>Firefox 3.6.x: </p>\n\n<p>Quote:</p>\n\n<p>open Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Encryption -> View Certificates -> Your Certificates -> Import\nHowever i need the same functionality from the bash command line.</p>\n\n<p>So far I've established that the following command is supposed to be used:</p>\n\n<pre><code>certutil -A -t “u,u,u” -d /home/df001/.mozilla/firefox/qe5y5lht.tc.default/ -n “mycert” -i client.p12\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This executes with no isses, however, doesn't show up in any Firefox Certificate store.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have noted that prior to running this command, i have a cert8.db key3.db and secmod.db file in the above folder. After running the command the certutil seems to have created a cert9.db, key4.db and pkcs12.txt file</p>\n\n<p>Listing the contents using the command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>certutil -L -d sql:/home/df001/.mozilla/firefox/qe5y5lht.tc.default/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>does seem to confirm my attempts of importing files into a certificate folder of some kind have worked. because i get</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Certificate Nickname Trust Attributes\n  SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI</p>\n  \n  <p>Thawte SSL CA „  Go Daddy Secure\n  Certification Authority „  Thawte SGC\n  CA „  Entrust Certification Authority\n  - L1C „  My Nero CT,C,c mynero P„  davidfield - Internet Widgits Pty Ltd\n  u,u,u</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, having tried this, and heading back over to the internet, I came across this command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pk12util -d /home/df001/.mozilla/firefox/qe5y5lht.tc.default/ -i client.p12 -n “David Field” -P “cert8.db”\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this again, appears to be importing something somewhere, however, again, Viewing certs from the Firefox interface doesn't show the imported Cert.</p>\n\n<p>I'm surmising here on reading that the certutil and pk12util are creating a new NSS database, which Firefox isn't reading. </p>\n\n<p>So my question is, how can i get the p12 cert from the command line so it displays in the Firefox Certificate manager interface?</p>\n\n<p>Why have i posted this here? Why not post on the Firefox forum? Well i will copy and post the same question there as well, however the ability to use the command line to do this is important, as I have potentially 2000 machines which will need a user cert imported into Firefox via a p12 file. I need to do this in the form of a script, i thought the hard part was going to be making the p12 file from the Microsoft 2003 CA, turns out thats easy. </p>\n\n<p>I can't just import via the GUI and copy over cert8.db x 2000, i can't ask users to use the CA web interface as its for VPN access, the users are off site, and they need the VPN to get to the cert server..</p>\n\n<p>Is there any person out there who can help?</p>\n\n<p>By the way, i don't have the tor button installed.</p>\n"},{"id":404962,"title":"How to protect my PC from netcut users?
