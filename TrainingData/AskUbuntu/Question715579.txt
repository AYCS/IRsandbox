[{"id":715579,"title":"Webpages not loading on one device but loads on another. How to fix this?","body":"<p>As it happens: none of the stackexchange sites open on my laptop, but they work fine on my tablet. </p>\n\n<p>I have tried the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cleared all cache cookies browser data. Didn't work.</li>\n<li>Used another browser. Didn't work.</li>\n<li>Tried browsing in incognito mode. Didn't work.</li>\n<li>Disabled add-ons and extensions. Didn't work.</li>\n<li>Restarted computer. Didn't work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>From these my diagnosis is that it is the device and not the browser. So here are facts about my device:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I am on ubuntu 14.04. I have installed a lot of things over time. But I don't remember installing anything harmful. Could it be because I haven't installed something essential yet? On chromium I use pepper flash. Firefox is unaltered since installation. </li>\n<li>Sometimes the stackexchange websites do load. But most of the time it would not. Could it be some malware?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>p.s.: the tablet and the laptop use the same network. So its not the network.
