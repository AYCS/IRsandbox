This was a scratch install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS via a bootable usb (which was created on my Macbook pro after I converted the .iso to a .img file) on a new computer that I just recently built.  I already contacted my school's IT department, and my MAC address is registered with them.  However, I am the only student running linux on the entire campus and they are unable to give me further support.  I have researched the forums extensively and have tried various solutions, but none seem to work.  I was advised by the IT department to leave my internet connection for IPv4 on automatic DHCP, rather than setting it to manual and copying the information from my laptop.  Additionally I tried using a friends USB wireless adapter (a Netgear Wireless N-300), but Ubuntu didn't recognize the device as a wireless adapter.
