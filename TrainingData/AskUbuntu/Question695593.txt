I installed two packages: <em>nvidia-common</em> and <em>nvidia-modprobe</em>, updating all installed packages in the process. I also ran <code>nvidia-xconfig</code> which created a xorg.conf in my /etc/X11/ folder. Finally I added <code>quiet splash nomodeset</code> to my grub.cfg (as opposed to adding them in the grub menu at each boot). After rebooting, I was able to watch videos in HD. I then deleted the xorg.conf and also purged the two packages I had just installed, and it still works. So either the updating of my installed packages or the boot parameters in the grub.cfg made the difference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2 (12/07/15)</strong>: So I removed the <code>quiet splash nomodeset</code> from my grub.cfg (and I didn't add them in the boot process either), and it still works.
