The second highest answer to the second question listed above says updating VirtualBox to the latest version, which at the time was 4.3.10 r93012, resolved the problem for that particular user, but I have an even later version (4.3.12 r93733), and when I do Help > Check for Updates, the updater pop-up says \"The network operation failed with the following error: Unknown reason.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Failed Resolution Path #5:</em></p>\n\n<p>In addition to the answers provided in the questions listed above, I've tried installing guest additions from the Devices menu in VirtualBox. The steps that I tried for this are log into the guest OS as super user, in the VirtualBox window go to Devices > Insert Guess Additions CD, click Run in the resulting pop-up, and authenticate as super user. After authenticating as super user, a terminal window opens up and does some things.

Because of this, I suspect that there must be some different process for resolving this issue on Ubuntu 14.04.2. By the way, I was able to resolve the small screen issue on a 14.04.1 guest by simply installing the virtualbox-guest-dkms package, but for 14.04.2 I've hit a brick wall.

Define new geometry with xrandr</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you need a fixed geometry that is not in the list of resolutions for monitors you will have to use xrandr to define a new resolution:</p>\n  \n  <p>First we use gtf for calculating the modeline of possible resolutions:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>gtf &lt;xres&gt; &lt;yres&gt; &lt;refresh&gt; [-x]\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Give the desired values for x-resolution, y-resolution and refresh rate.
