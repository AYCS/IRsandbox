[{"id":518687,"title":"Missing Operating System - Windows7 - Boot from USB","body":"<p>I am using an HP TouchSmart 600 that came from factory with Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit. I have decided to get rid of it and installed Ubuntu 14.04 booting from usb and everything went perfect. Now i want to install again Windows 7 so i have downloaded the iso image from the web and created a bootable usb using YUMI from pendrivelinux.com (my CD/DVD does not work and i dont have original windows cd) after reboot i keep getting this message \"Missing Operating System\", then Ubuntu is loaded normally. </p>\n\n<p>I have been solving this for several days already and tried everything in the forums but nothing worked for me:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I have downloaded many different iso versions from the web to make sure the files were not corrupted.</p></li>\n<li><p>I have formatted the usb with gparted in NTFS and also in FAT32 before installing the iso and i have also tried to boot in all possible usb slots to make sure i am using the primary one. </p></li>\n<li><p>I have updated the BIOS to boot from the usb device as a very first option. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate someone can advise me where the problem could be so i keep trying cause so far i completely ran out of ideas. </p>\n\n<p>PS: Pls note i am not using any partition, i just want to install windows 7 back in my machine and after that i will probably use dual-boot to keep using ubuntu. I wanted to add how the usb looks like but when i run the tree command from terminal is a very long file so just for your reference this is what i can see in the root: i have 6 folders (boot, efi, sources, support, upgrade, yumi) and 4 files (autorun.inf, bootmgr, bootmgr.efi, setup.exe) </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your help and please let me know if you need any extra information from my side. </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":708951,"title":"Ubuntu booting from USB errors","body":"<p>I am using a lot of software from my bootable USB with no problems until lately.
