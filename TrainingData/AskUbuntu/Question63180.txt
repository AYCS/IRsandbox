[{"id":63180,"title":"Slow installation of applications in Ubuntu Software Center?","body":"<p>I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 desktop and I am in the process of learning. I want to install some applications from the Ubuntu Software Center, but the installation process is quite long and slow. With the Ubuntu Software Center, I can only install and download one application for a time. So I want to ask is there a way to speed up the process of installing software through the Ubuntu Software Center, like a multi-tasking program?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":686716,"title":"Installing Ubuntu Software Center not working","body":"<p>Okay so I was trying to install spotify on my computer and was having issues with that. I arrived at a solution that brought me to downloading it through the software center when, lo and behold it didn't work. I would click on it and it would just close. So I tried to uninstall and reinstall it. Unistalling it went fine, but reinstalling it isn't working. </p>\n\n<p>First I tried <code>sudo apt-get install software-center</code> and that didn't work I was told \"E: Package 'software-center' has no installation candidate\" </p>\n\n<p>So next I tried <code>sudo apt-get synaptic</code> because I found a source telling me that I could get the software center through synaptic. but I got the same error as before, this time telling me synaptic has no installation candidate.</p>\n\n<p>I tried <code>sudo get-apt update</code> from <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/301096/installing-software-center-ubuntu\">this source right here</a>, but no help. I get this message \"E: Type 'sudo' is not known on line 1 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spotify.list\"</p>\n\n<p>Again from this source I tried <code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</code>\n and it didn't work. </p>\n\n<p>I'm stuck and I have no idea what I'm doing I've been running ubuntu barely a week after switching from windows.</p>\n"},{"id":635481,"title":"Scope of Ubuntu Software Center","body":"<p>I found a similar q&amp;a here <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/166247/is-apt-get-install-method-the-same-as-ubuntu-software-centre-installation\">Is apt-get install method the same as Ubuntu software centre installation?</a> but my experience suggests this is not a completely accurate answer.</p>\n\n<p>I put 'ubuntu video downloader' in google, and got a hit for 'all video downloader', <a href=\"https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/allvideodownloader/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/allvideodownloader/</a>. When I saw it had a big sticker saying it was available on the software center, I switched over to that on my desktop. To my surprise, this app was nowhere to be found. I have been googling on this issue for way too long without finding an answer, so I am posting.</p>\n\n<p>I am running 15.04, and the apps.ubuntu page stops at 14.04 under 'available versions'. Is that why I am not seeing it in the Software Center? Could it have been removed from the Software Center? I see a lot of command line tools and libraries for video parsing in Software Center; are the guis just not up to speed on 15.04 yet? </p>\n\n<p>So even though this specific app brought me here, it really is a broader question, as I hope the title conveys: How does Software Center really work? How is it different from, in sync with (or not) apps.ubuntu? What's included in Software Center and what isn't, why, and how would I know (other than posting here)?

My PC has more than enough power to handle this (I'm running a 64 bit machine), so it's not a hardware issue. I've seen a similar thread to this but no clear answer on how to remedy the problem was given. It took me 30 minutes to install a game I downloaded, this was on top of the download time, and my PC was effectively unusable during this period. Other software I've downloaded (Skype, Wine etc) were slow to install.
