One big problem is that I can't get USB access to copy data, either as a USB drive or using adb.  My computer is a MacBook running Yosemite, I also have a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu Trusty.  When I plug the phone into the MacBook there's a bunch of stuff in the phone's dmesg:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[102352.913708] musb-hdrc musb-hdrc: &lt;== Power=f1, DevCtl=99, int_usb=0x4\n[102352.913731] musb-hdrc musb-hdrc: BUS RESET as b_peripheral\n[102352.913784] [U3D][U2 RESET_INTR]\n[102352.913791] [U3D]USB Speed = High Speed\n[102353.215731] mtp_open\n[102353.253474] mtp_release\n[102353.253498] mtp_release, line 1846: _mtp_dev-&gt;dev_disconnected = 1\n[102353.332582] mtp_open\n[102353.356133] mtp_release\n[102353.356156] mtp_release, line 1846: _mtp_dev-&gt;dev_disconnected = 1\n[102353.432300] mtp_open\n[102353.450624] mtp_release\n[102353.450647] mtp_release, line 1846: _mtp_dev-&gt;dev_disconnected = 1\n[102353.518418] mtp_open\n[102353.540273] mtp_release\n[102353.540295] mtp_release, line 1846: _mtp_dev-&gt;dev_disconnected = 1\n[102353.602370] mtp_open\n[102353.623471] mtp_release\n[102353.623495] mtp_release, line 1846: _mtp_dev-&gt;dev_disconnected = 1\n[102353.663670] android_usb gadget: high-speed config #1: android\n[102353.663691] mtp_function_set_alt intf: 0 alt: 0\n[102353.733945] mtp_open\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But there's nothing at all in the MacBook's dmesg.
