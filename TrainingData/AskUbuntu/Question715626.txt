After that, I switch to Ubuntu, and run iwlist scan, and feel really surprised to see tons of output coming from the terminal. Now everything works out of the box again!</p>\n\n<p>I remembered that when I was trying to suspend my laptop the night I installed the compat driver for the first time, it took longer than usual, so I long-pressed the power button. Since then, the laptop would fail to recover if I closed its lid to suspend it. And the wireless stopped working the morning after that.</p>\n\n<p>So the real problem may have little to do with the wireless driver. I guess an internal switch in the hardware was toggled during halting, so the card ceased to scan for connections. However, the Windows driver is clever (or lucky) enough to re-enable the card, and things work out.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot reproduce the problem now so some of the logs are incomplete. However, the problem is fixed anyway. And I witnessed a sharp increase in my productivity during the nights when my laptop could not connect to wifi.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time.
