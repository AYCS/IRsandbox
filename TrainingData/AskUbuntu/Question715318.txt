I have general knowledge about bash programming, administration. Lately have dived into Raspberry PI and Ubuntu based distro.  </p>\n\n<p>Wondering if there's any book out there on the market which describes in easy way topics like for example: problems with grub on ubuntu, how it is build and where and why it is placed. What is chroot and how to use it and what for. </p>\n\n<p>I know only books like linux bash scripting cookbook and administration but actually for now I don't need to know about backup, cron and other utilities. For example I've been looking for info about boken grub on my Windows 10 / Ubuntu machine and I'm not able to tackle the problem because I still expirience problems with dependences, etc......After 4 hours of fighting it I'm still at the begining becasue of lack of knowledge i guess.</p>\n\n<p>coming back to the knowledge in books, offcourse it is very handy to know how to use system log but without deep knowledge about how touchpad or wifi card is programmed, configured in linux it is useless.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if I'm clear enough and question maybe not precise but....Anyone ?

It was a bit of a struggle, but I was able to rack my brain and remember what all I needed to do to get these devices back up and running, with no more lost comms. </p>\n\n<p>I used to work with Ubuntu and Red Hat on a daily basis, but it has been several years and have forgot mostly things.

So I need to get back in the game and I was hoping you guys would be able to point me to some good refresher guides. Im sure the knowledge is still there, I just need some items to jar it lose. </p>\n\n<p>So some links or titles of books would be great! Ive never been the best at posting on forums, but I am doing this for work and would like to learn all I can about this. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks and have a great day people!</p>\n"},{"id":701243,"title":"Is there a devie manager in Linux?","body":"<p>Is there a any option in Linux specifically Ubuntu 14.04 from where I can manage all my devices like \"device manager\" in windows?</p>\n"},{"id":560295,"title":"What to do if the CD I want to use cannot be run on ubuntu/linux","body":"<p>As a high-school, we decided to use Edubuntu on classes, labs etc. Edubuntu is OK with Activ Inspire.
