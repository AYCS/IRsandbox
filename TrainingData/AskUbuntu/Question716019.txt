What's stranger however is that it appears activity continues as normal behind the screen. I only discovered this last night whilst simply watching a video through XBMC. The screen froze (although the mouse still moved), but all sound continued whilst the video did not. Pressing the spacebar stopped the sound, and pressing it once more and the sound continued, so it wasn't a complete system crash.</p>\n\n<p>I went through the log files for everything major such as Xorg, kern, faillog, syslog etc but nothing really stood out. </p>\n\n<p>My initial thought was graphicscard/driver issues.\nI have hybrid graphics with Intel Ivybridge (i7) and the NVidia GK107M.

The list of drives is replaced with the same message for every entry : \"Please select the booting drive\" which won't do anything; so, I have to enter the Bios every time in order to boot Ubuntu and switch the Hard Drives boot priority.
