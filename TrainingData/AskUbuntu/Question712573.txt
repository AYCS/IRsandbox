I've tried about every answer/solution/suggestion on askUbuntu for about 6-7+ hours now, describing connecting wireless interface to a wired NIC on the Ubuntu computer which will then connect to/serve a router's uplink.</p>\n\n<p>Internet access at this site is over a cell phone's wireless hotspot which really doesn't stink as much as it sounds like it would.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier a Windows machine was responsible for making connection to the cell phone hotspot, and a wired Ethernet NIC with static IP on the same Windows machine provided the Up/Downlink to a router.  This gave local devices both internet access plus LAN communications to one another, and as it turns out the wireless AP feature of the router covers a wider physical area than the little cell phone hotspot.</p>\n\n<p>As folks noted elsewhere on askUbuntu, with Windows it was merely necessary to \"bridge\" (in Windows terminology which may vary from strict definitions) the wireless and wired interfaces.  In under a minute the Windows-host was handling traffic between the WAN side of the router and the wireless adapter which supplied internet access; it all worked swimmingly.</p>\n\n<p>SO, now I'm trying to replace the exact capability that was supplied by the Windows PC with the ubuntu 14.04 machine.  True, I'd also like to leverage the ubuntu 14.04 machine a bit more, making it participate in the LAN so it has access to printers and offers some of its RAID storage over Samba.</p>\n\n<p>Since we're talking about the same router, same wireless hot spot, and same server hardware (running ubuntu instead of Windows), I suspect there should be a correct software configuration available to do it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lmQB4.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lmQB4.png\" alt=\"Illustration of desired configuration\"></a></p>\n\n<p>My own attempts so far have failed.  I've approached this in many ways described such as: Network Manager with a bridge and assigned slaves; Network Manager with a connection marked as \"shared to other computers\" (which one person said would do some NATting); also tried setting up bridge in /etc/network/interfaces. </p>\n\n<p>Generally in most of the approaches tried, I can reach the Router for administration over eth1 connection to the LOCAL side of the router.  The Router uplink to eth0 card connection looks good.   But as far as traffic flowing over the wireless adapter: nope.  Nada.  Perhaps I blew the configuration on every attempt.  Meanwhile for example the answer at <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/3063/share-wireless-connection-with-wired-ethernet-port\">Share Wireless connection with Wired Ethernet Port</a> suggested something (similar) was about as easy as Windows was.  </p>\n\n<p>Could be because I have flu these past couple days but after 8 (or now 10??) hours on this subject I'm ready to ask for the recipe, especially one specific to 14.04 LTS.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"id":633087,"title":"Wireless is not working in Ubuntu 15.04","body":"<p>I have an Intel Centrino N-1030 [raindbow peak] wireless card in my Dell Laptop.

But let me finish my story first.</p>\n\n<p>I reboot my system to Windows 8 to make sure that the wireless card is OK. After that, I switch to Ubuntu, and run iwlist scan, and feel really surprised to see tons of output coming from the terminal. Now everything works out of the box again!</p>\n\n<p>I remembered that when I was trying to suspend my laptop the night I installed the compat driver for the first time, it took longer than usual, so I long-pressed the power button. Since then, the laptop would fail to recover if I closed its lid to suspend it. And the wireless stopped working the morning after that.</p>\n\n<p>So the real problem may have little to do with the wireless driver. I guess an internal switch in the hardware was toggled during halting, so the card ceased to scan for connections. However, the Windows driver is clever (or lucky) enough to re-enable the card, and things work out.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot reproduce the problem now so some of the logs are incomplete. However, the problem is fixed anyway. And I witnessed a sharp increase in my productivity during the nights when my laptop could not connect to wifi.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your time. Really appreciate your help.</p>\n"},{"id":210017,"title":"How to debug wifi connection?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/14008/i-have-a-hardware-detection-problem-what-logs-do-i-need-to-look-into\">I have a hardware detection problem, what logs do I need to look into?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I am using Ubuntu's <code>Network Manager</code> to connect to a local wifi router.
