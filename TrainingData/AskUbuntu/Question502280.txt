Ubuntu had a Hall of Fame page (then located at <a href=\"http://hall-of-fame.ubuntu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hall-of-fame.ubuntu.com</a>) in which it would give credits to contributors such as developers who patched a bug in the One Hundred Papercuts project or the top weekly contributors right here on Ask Ubuntu.

Extensive Googling has yielded no answers in any form. The the last snapshot of the site by web.archive.org reveals no clues, either (it looks perfectly normal, and then there are no more snapshots).</p>\n\n<p>So I'm curious- why was it removed?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":64284,"title":"What does thisisthecountdown.com count down to?","body":"<p>The new cool page created by Ubuntu-adverts team <a href=\"http://www.thisisthecountdown.com/\">http://www.thisisthecountdown.com/</a> displays a nice counter, and an Ubuntu logo followed by a short motto. It seems, however, that it's not counting down to the Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot release. So what's the <em>time zero</em>, and what is expected to happen when the counter reaches zero?</p>\n"},{"id":36734,"title":"What happened to the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter?","body":"<p>I just noticed that no new \"Weekly\" newsletter has been released since <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue219\" rel=\"nofollow\">January</a>, and I can't seem to find any information on <em>why</em> the newsletter has been put on hold for this long.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know more?</p>\n"}]}]
