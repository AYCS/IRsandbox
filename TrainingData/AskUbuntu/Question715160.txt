Since the upgrade from 15.04 I have noticed that when I double click a window, that window seems to take focus (e.g., the gnome top bar text and icon change to that of the application whose window was clicked), but for all intents and purposes it <em>does not</em> have focus - text is still typed in the previous application, etc. </p>\n\n<p>The only way I have found to <em>really</em> make an application take focus, is to click the title bar of the application. I am assuming this is a configuration/settings issue, but I have not been able to fix it in the <code>gnome-tweak-tool</code> or in the settings menu. </p>\n\n<p>Is this a bug, the new intended behavior in 15.10, or just a setting I need to adjust?
