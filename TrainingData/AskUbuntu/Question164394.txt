What I have achieved so far is more like a bad patchwork than a good solution.</p>\n\n<p>I use Thunderbird as my standard mail program. There exists an extension called <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/de/thunderbird/addon/mailbox-alert/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mailbox Alert</a> which makes it possible to trigger a custom command when a new E-Mail arrives. It can forward the sender's name, E-Mail address, subject and so on as parameters to a program of ones choice. I wrote a short bash script which takes these parameters, issues an OSD Message via notify-send and echos the sender and the subject of the E-Mail into a simple textfile \"mail.dat\".\nWith the help of the gnome-shell-extension <a href=\"https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/912/command-output/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Command Output</a> , which makes it possible to display a custom bash command in the top panel, I can display the contents of the \"mail.dat\" file via <code>cat mail.dat</code>. The extension works in a way that it issues that <code>cat</code>command every n seconds and therefore updates the label in the top bar when changes in the file \"mail.dat\" occur.\nNow as I only want to have unread messages displayed there, I also need an event which clears the \"mail.dat\" file when I mark the E-mail as read or delete it. Luckily, the extension \"FireTray\" for Thunderbird can also issue a custom command when the number of unread messages changes. So if the number changes to zero, it issues a command which clears the \"mail.dat\" and the Gnome-Shell-Extensions then updates the label in the top panel (after some seconds, corresponding to the update interval of the <code>cat</code> command). </p>\n\n<p>This works more or less but appears to me like the biggest detour in the history of prgramming. There are two obvious things that bother me: \nFirst: There are two Thunderbird-Extensions, two Bash-scripts and text file involved in order to achieve what I want. That's definitely to much.\nSecond: The extension issues the <code>cut</code> command every second. I think it is not necessary to have a read action on a file on a ssd-drive every second. There has to be a better way to update the label (e.g. only issues that <code>cat</code> command when the file changes --> Is there something like a FileChangeListener?)</p>\n\n<p>So here is the question: How do I make this better? What I would first like to change is the number of read events. I am not sure if this could be an issue for my ssd if the same part gets read every second (or what does <code>cat</code> do?).</p>\n\n<p>I would not consider myself as a good programmer and I am really not familiar with javascript, so it would be hard for me to write an entire new extension (for either Thunderbird or Gnome-Shell).</p>\n\n<p>I hope my question is clear and I posted it at the right forum.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\n"},{"id":119507,"title":"How to move the &quot;hot corner&quot; of the messaging tray in gnome-shell?","body":"<p>I have two monitors, side by side, and my main monitor is on the left. </p>\n\n<p>In Gnome Shell, the task-bar can be quickly looked at by moving the mouse to the bottom right hot corner, but since I have a monitor to the right, it is really hard to not simply fly over to the next monitor when trying to access it. </p>\n\n<p>Can I move that hot corner so that it is on the left bottom corner? </p>\n"},{"id":247456,"title":"Are dconf values for &#39;top-panel&#39; and &#39;bottom-panel&#39; used by Gnome Shell?","body":"<ul>\n<li>Gnome Shell 3.6.2  </li>\n<li>Ubuntu 12.10 64 bit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>/org/gnome/gnome-panel/layout/toplevels/bottom-panel</code> has several options theoretically to customize the behavior of Gnome panels.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to set that the bottom bar is showed faster and that it is automatically hidden.
