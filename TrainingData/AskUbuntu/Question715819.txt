[{"id":715819,"title":"How can I begin to track down this Wi-Fi problem?","body":"<p>This is not your run-of-the-mill \"what's wrong with my Wi-Fi\" question, I'll guarantee you that...</p>\n\n<p>I inherited a <a href=\"http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/ideacentre/stick-300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lenovo Ideacentre Stick 300</a> and have been trying to get Windows 10 off of it and Ubuntu onto it. The hardware seems to be the same as the much more popular <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/compute-stick/intel-compute-stick.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intel Compute Stick</a>, so I've been starting with walkthroughs like <a href=\"http://liliputing.com/2015/07/install-ubuntu-14-04-lts-on-the-2gb-intel-compute-stick.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these</a> to get up and running. Ubuntu 14.04 actually installs, boots, and runs a full GUI with working Wi-Fi and sound. But I discovered a bizarre problem that I'm not sure how to even begin tracking down:</p>\n\n<p>My use case for this machine calls for it to run headless, and as such I figured it would be a waste to always start the full GUI. So I went into <code>/etc/default/grub</code> and changed</p>\n\n<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to</p>\n\n<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then I ran <code>sudo update-grub2</code>. After rebooting, my Wi-Fi performance was <em>terrible</em>. Dropped packets, ping times in the 700ms range, and so much lag that SSH was practically unusable. I set the cmdline back to <code>\"quiet splash\"</code>, rebooted, and it went back to normal.</p>\n\n<p>As a second test, I booted back into <code>\"text\"</code> and, as expected, saw horrible performance. I ran <code>sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm start</code> over an SSH connection and almost immediately the Wi-Fi performance became acceptable. Once lightdm started, killing it had no effect on the performance.</p>\n\n<p>How on earth can I start tracking down the correlation between Wi-Fi performance and whether or not the GUI has been started? The driver is the Realtek rtl8723bs, which seems to have a track record of being not-very-good.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":471986,"title":"Problems with Wireless since upgrade to 14.04","body":"<p>My laptop is a Toshiba Satellite L750, which has a Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter in it. When I was running 13.10 it all worked perfectly fine, but ever since I upgraded to 14.04 - literally, ever since the reboot after installing it - it has been problematic. The curious thing is though, it is only problematic connecting to the home Wi-fi and not to other wi-fi services. Specifically, I am now connected to my Android phone acting as a wi-fi hotspot so that I can post this question, and it works perfectly. This laptop is the only device in the house that has trouble connecting to this wi-fi router as well - our tablets and phones all connect perfectly well, as does my partners Windows laptop. Also, the connection to the home wi-fi will sometimes work perfectly well and other times just not work at all, and the only thing I've been able to find that will make any difference at all is to just wait and try again later. If it doesn't work now - which it doesn't - then in an hours time it might work perfectly well as if nothing was wrong, but if I then shut the lid and come back it will stop working again...</p>\n\n<p>Information: </p>\n\n<p><code>$ lspci | grep -Ei wireless\n02:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) (rev 01)\n$ lshw\n.....\n           *-network\n                description: Wireless interface\n                product: AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express)\n                vendor: Qualcomm Atheros\n                physical id: 0\n                bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n                logical name: wlan0\n                version: 01\n                serial: e0:ca:94:98:ec:00\n                width: 64 bits\n                clock: 33MHz\n                capabilities: bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n                configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath9k driverversion=3.13.0-24-generic firmware=N/A ip=192.168.43.212 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n                resources: irq:17 memory:c0500000-c050ffff\n.....\n$ uname -a\nLinux daedalus 3.13.0-24-generic #47-Ubuntu SMP Fri May 2 23:30:00 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux</code></p>\n\n<p>A section of /var/log/syslog from when it tries to connect to the home wi-fi is pasted at <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/dPHEa7p8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pastebin.com/dPHEa7p8</a> too - as it was rather too long to stick in here...</p>\n"},{"id":673834,"title":"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS not Starts GUI","body":"<p>I installed Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS on my HP Pavilion G4 1115br and when I start it does not load the GUI: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjYsNPcS2OU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS problem in not Loads GUI - Part 1/2</a>.

Please forgive me if my lingo isn't up to par.</p>\n\n<p>I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 last night. After I removed the installation disk (when I was prompted to do such) and restarted, the computer started up and I was eventually prompted to put in my passphrase. After that was successfully accepted, the screen went black but my cursor still showed up and I was able to move it around. I tried ctrl+alt+del but to no avail. A few minutes of just the screen led to: </p>\n\n<pre><code>[121.855415] nouveau E[    DRM] GPU lockup - switch to software fbcon\n\n[142.180021] nouveau E[Xorg[1254]] failed to idle channel 0xcccc0001 [Xorg[1254]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With that second line repeating but with different numbers in the brackets. So I looked around for people in similar situations and found that most people went to GRUB and added\n\"nomodeset\" after quiet splash. However, I couldn't figure out how to deal with the $vt_handoff that was present right after \"quiet splash\" in GRUB. So, I just stuck nomodeset after $vt_handoff and hit ctrl+X. </p>\n\n<p>After the encryption prompt working successfully (as it has every time), I was actually brought to the desktop screen. I thought I had fixed the situation when a problem report window popped up asking me to support the bug report and the screen went fuzzy. It made it difficult for me to document what the bug report contained but I was able to make some stuff out: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Executable path\n\n  /usr/bin/Xorg\n\nPackage\n\n  Xserver-xorg-Core 2: 1.15.1-0ubuntu2\n\nProblemType\n\n  Crash\n\nTitle \n\n  Xorg crashed with SIGABRT\n\nApport Version \n\n  2.14.1-0ubuntu3.2\n\nArchitecture\n\n  Amd64\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, it was difficult to discern what was in the report. Moving the cursor around somehow caused the screen to look better for a bit but scrolling down through report made things difficult again. </p>\n\n<p>I restarted again after that to see that I'm back to a black screen with the cursor which leads me to believe that \"nomodeset\" did not stick and I'll have to reapply it. </p>\n\n<p>The computer with the problems is a Dell Dimension E521 with BIOS 1.1.11. I did the 64-Bit install from a Live Disc while using Windows XP. </p>\n\n<p>Does anybody have an idea what to do? If you guys needs more info on the computer, I'll get is ASAP.
