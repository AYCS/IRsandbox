[{"id":580677,"title":"Installing Ubuntu on Acer Chromebook 13?","body":"<p>Hey guys I was looking to install Ubuntu on my Acer Chromebook 13 (CB5-311-T1UU) in the way outlined in on the comment made on this thread:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/356243/true-ubuntu-on-chromebook-arm-samsung\">True Ubuntu on Chromebook ARM (samsung)</a></p>\n\n<p>It appears that you can't fully remove ChromeOS from a Chromebook (well, you can but it really struggles) but you can make it dual boot and make it boot into Ubuntu by default. I'll show you the last method.</p>\n\n<p>First make a backup of all you local files because everything stored locally will be deleted by entering developer mode.</p>\n\n<p>Press and hold the <kbd>Esc</kbd> and Refresh keys together, then press the Power button (while still holding the other two keys). This will reboot your Chromebook into Recovery Mode.</p>\n\n<p>When you get the yellow screen with the exclamation mark hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> (This will bring up a prompt asking if you want to turn on Developer Mode.) Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (this will take about 15 to 20 min. You'll get a screen with a red exclamation mark but leave it be until it reboots into ChromeOS).</p>\n\n<p>Turn it on but do not login. Make sure you have a WiFi or Ethernet connection configured at this point. 3G/4G is not recommended. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd> (<kbd>→</kbd> is the forward arrow where the <kbd>F2</kbd> key would be on a PC). Do not use the normal <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd> method to get a shell. Use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>→</kbd> method while no one is logged in.</p>\n\n<p>Login as user chronos, no password is needed.</p>\n\n<p>As the chronos user and without having changed directories or run other commands, run:</p>\n\n<p><code>curl -L -O http://goo.gl/s9ryd; sudo bash s9ryd</code>\n(There is a new script with a new link. If you still want to use the old version you'll have to replace the new link with the old link)\n<code>curl -L -O http://goo.gl/9sgchs; sudo bash 9sgchs...</code></p>\n\n<p>But it did not do anything when I pressed <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Does anyone know if there is a specific build for the Acer Chromebook 13?</em> </p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":474489,"title":"I cant get back into Ubuntu after turning off my Acer c710 Chromebook","body":"<p>I took about 1 hour installing Ubuntu to my Acer chrome book.

I was kinda fed up with the Chrome OS so I decided to try downloading a different OS, and my friends told me that Ubuntu could be easily installed. I searched up the instructions, had no problem following them until after I finished the installation process, had it all installed, it opened a loading screen, and popped me to the Ubuntu 15.04 chrubuntu tty1 startup page. There I tried to login. The set of instructions I used told me to use user as my username as well as my password. As soon as I did that, I got a long block of text, but I haven't figured how to actually boot up the operating system and use my computer. It's giving me an option to type in a command, but even after searching the web, I haven't found anything that I can do. I still have the option to go back to the Chrome OS but I'd rather not.

I'm really low on budget, and considering buying new netbook for starting using Ubuntu, after a lame Win 8 decided to move on Linux based systems. So for the starter I want to move on Ubuntu  step by step. I choosed Acer C7 Chromebook mostly for it's price, and seem all technical characteristics are enough to run Ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>I've read a lot of reviews on Acer C7 with chrUbuntu, but still have some question. As I understand this chrUbuntu isn't an official project, and canonical doesn't support it. Also it seems that some users do have a little troubles with 12.10 version, like sound for mic and ets. So what's going to happen with 13.04? Does this Acer C7 worth buying as Ubuntu netbook? Appreciate your advices.</p>\n"}]}]
