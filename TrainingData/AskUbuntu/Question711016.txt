Windows 7 was installed on the SSD, so I went ahead with installing Ubuntu onto the HDD. I used a DVD with Ubuntu written on it and booted from the removable disk drive (by changing the option on BIOS option page). I mostly followed instructions I found from several threads here such as creating \"/, /home, /swap\" (I am planning to do some intensive data processing). I then selected the option of booting from 'sdb' which was the HDD that I was installing Ubuntu on. 'sda' is the SSD with Windows. </p>\n\n<p>However when I restarted my computer, I was able to successfully boot to Ubuntu, but when I tried to change back to booting from Windows (located on the SSD), I could not do so. I was brought to a black screen with 'Windows Error Recovery' indicating that Windows files were 'damaged or configured incorrectly'. I tried to Launch Startup Repair (recommended), but would be brought back repeatedly to this screen i.e. it did not work. So I tried to Start Windows Normally, but was brought to a second page stating 'Reboot and Select Proper Boot Device or Insert Boot Media in selected device and press a key'. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Picture links:</strong> <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Q6419fd.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/Q6419fd.jpg</a> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/iNwBSZ5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/iNwBSZ5.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>I am not sure what exactly I did wrong.
