I tried to install Wine and Pipelight to play Netflix on my computer. Big mistake! Something happened, and when I tried to remove the thing it isn't removing completely. In fact, my computer refuses to acknowledge Pipelight exists on my computer.\nThis pesky little poltergeist isn't just doing something as simple as making it impossible to use Netflix; it's actually preventing me from updating my computer! Automatic updates aren't getting anywhere. Whenever I try to update using <code>sudo apt-get update</code> it updates part of the way, and then... I get an error message reading <code>E: The package pipelight-multi needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.</code>\nWhat in the world is this? This glitch/bug/what-have-you is seriously crippling my computer. It's wreaking some serious havoc.

I do not know if my cache doesn't exist or what to do exactly. I'd like to just update to 13.10 but it won't let me run the package manager and I am not able to do so manually.
