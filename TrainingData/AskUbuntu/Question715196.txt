After installing it, I immediately installed Ubuntu 14.04 on it from a USB drive. Everything went fine during installation, but when I restarted I got the message \"Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot Device and press a key\". That message came up after a nano second screen that says \"Checking Media Presence\" and then \"No Media Present\".</p>\n\n<p>When I reboot using the USB stick, I can see the SSD drive and it has the OS written on it and it looks like it's been partitioned correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone please tell me what I need to do to get my computer to boot up? I read something about how the Secure boot and CSM or UEFI might be a factor, but I'm not experienced enough with new Bios to know how to configure those settings. I also read about Grub probably not installing on the SSD and I might just have to fix Grub for it to work, but I haven't been able to do that through the Ubuntu running of the USB stick.\nAny help or links to good threads would be very helpful.

The BIOS of my motherboard (an Asus Crosshair 990FX) is strictly UEFI -- there is no legacy support mode available.  I've been reading up on how to get Kubuntu installed in UEFI mode but no matter what I try I cannot seem to even boot into my install CD/USB key properly.</p>\n\n<p>I can get as far as the selection screen (\"Try Kubuntu\", \"Install Kubuntu\"...) but this screen starts off not appearing correctly.  If I try moving the cursor around it sometimes seems to correct itself and show me my choices.  But once I select \"Try Kubuntu\" it starts loading, the screen goes black and then proceeds to flicker -- about once every 5-10 seconds or so.  This continues indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried this with both Kubuntu &amp; Ubuntu installation media, even the AMD64+Mac Ubuntu variety that is supposed to be a lot more flexible w.r.t. UEFI.  The <em>only</em> hint I've had that the system might have booted correctly is a little drum sound that plays when booting from the Ubuntu install disk.  Well, that and the fact that when I hit my system's power button it seems to shut down correctly, even ejecting the CD at the end.</p>\n\n<p>This might be a video driver issue; my system has two nVidia 550's, one of which is attached to my primary monitor.  (The secondary isn't hooked up yet.)  I'll keep looking over similar questions but any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:  I've tried booting into my 12.04 install CD twice now, each time using two different options supplied by my BIOS.  One seemed to offer the ability to boot into my CD under UEFI mode -- this didn't even produce the initial boot menu.  The other method offers the ability to boot into my CD NOT under UEFI mode.  This DOES produce the boot menu, but after this point it seems I still cannot get to a proper video mode to see what's going on.</p>\n"},{"id":131125,"title":"Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit after-installation help","body":"<p>I installed Ubuntu 12/04 64 bit on my desktop using the Nomodeset on boot screen.
