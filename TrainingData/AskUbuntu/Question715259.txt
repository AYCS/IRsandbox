[{"id":715259,"title":"Keeps kicking me off whenever I log in / Unable to shut down / Other things","body":"<p>So ever since I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my computer a few months back after building it, the Software Updater has been pestering me to download updates. Just earlier today, I decided why not, and began to update it. After a while it suddenly stopped, and told me that there was something wrong with my internet connection, which seemed to be fine, so I finished it up.</p>\n\n<p>Before I got to the weird part, recently whenever I log onto my account a there is a popup telling me that there is a \"System Program Problem\", and a button that says \"Cancel\" and another that says \"Report problem\". I looked on some questions regarding that on here earlier, apparently it's some thing that pops up whenever a background program crashed, or something like that. I assumed that was the case. Unfortunately, I really could have looked into it more.</p>\n\n<p>After the updates were installed, Ubuntu started going crazy. Whenever I logged into my account, my desktop came up, but then it glitches and kicks me back to the login screen. The guest account is fine, but there's the same popup as well as another saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sorry, Ubuntu 14.04 has experienced an internal error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It says that if I experience errors, I should restart the computer, and I have, but it did nothing. In addition to that, there is no internet connection.</p>\n\n<p>When I click shutdown on the guest account, there are only the lock and logout buttons. When I do it from the login screen, there are only the words, no button.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you are quick enough and manage to click \"Cancel\" on the System Program Problem popup, it doesn't kick you off. However, it is barely usable. The desktop font size glitches from one to another and my desktop buttons and cursor are disappearing and reappearing, not to mention that I have no internet connection.</p>\n\n<p>I just don't understand what the problem is. Can anyone help me?</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":629373,"title":"User account history showing incorrectly","body":"<p>I have found that in <code>System Settings &gt; User Accounts</code> that if you select an account and then select the button called <code>History</code> (which is meant to show the login history for that account), it will show you when you last logged in as <code>Session Started</code>, but it will show that you <code>Session Ended</code> just before you login the next time.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify what I mean, let's say that yesterday I logged into my account on this machine at <code>14:29</code>, and then sometime near <code>23:00</code> I logged out, and then this morning I logged into my account somewhere around <code>11:20</code>, it will show this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Today 11:20 Session Started\n    Today 11:19 Session Ended\n    Yesterday, 14:29 Session Started\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So it assumes that the last session ended when you log into a new one, so the bug seems to be that it does not log when a session ends properly, and only logs it when a new session starts.</p>\n\n<p>So it will show this sort of thing:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vHuZ6.png\" alt=\"Login History GUI\"></p>\n\n<p>Why is this? And how can I fix this?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Information Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I set up another account on the same machine, and ran the command: </p>\n\n<pre><code>loginctl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the only accounts that were active (after I logged out of the other account) were <code>lightdm</code> and the current user account. So I know that the session properly shutdown, so why does it not log that it shuts down?

This has been the case since the most recent Feb. 2015 updates.  </p>\n\n<p>I've looked through all the settings that make any sense to change - actually, all settings just in case I missed something in System Settings.  Nothing seems to work.  On \"suspend when inactive for,\" it's set to \"don't suspend,\" etc.  The screen dim setting is turned off so it's not going to screen dim out.  It's plugged in all the time so it won't go to power critical.  Etc. </p>\n\n<p>Processes will be running and so forth.  I will come back to the machine, boom, the thing is shut down. I wonder if something in the recent updates is set to measure non-activity on the keyboard after a certain length of time since so far I have had mostly routine processes such as Firefox up. </p>\n\n<p>Also of note, this is a Wubi install that has not yet been migrated to a partition.  This hasn't had any issues at all.  But should be the same basic nature to address here as for any other 14.04 LTS installation.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone uses this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>wget -q -O - https://fixubuntu.com/fixubuntu.sh | bash\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'd be interested to know your thoughts on it.

That's actually quite good so that can't be the problem.</p></li>\n<li><p>Next I thought it may be a driver issue but I've downloaded the latest driver from Nvidia and I'm still having issues. I'm on version 304.123. Are there any alternative drivers I should be looking at?</p></li>\n<li><p>Next I thought it could be a problem with my media or media player but I've tried different types of media in different media players and they all have the same issue. I used to run this PC in Windows for years and never had this issue so it's probably not a hardware problem.</p></li>\n<li><p>Beyond that, I don't really know what to check. My motherboard or graphics card could have compatibility problems with Ubuntu but I don't think that's likely. This sort of thing can sometimes be a problem with the PSU as well but although this one is around 3 years old, it is really good quality and has plenty of power for my components.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only thing I can see from the system log that looks like an error from the time of the crash is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sep 29 20:05:11 james-pc gnome-session[1293]: GLib-CRITICAL: g_environ_setenv: assertion 'value != NULL' failed\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any ideas on what to try next?
