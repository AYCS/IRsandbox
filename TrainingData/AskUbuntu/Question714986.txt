However a couple of days ago it auto-updated to a new version of ubuntu. Looking at the details in settings, it said it was 14.04. After this update the PC would not pickup the ethernet cable that was connected, therefore we couldn't use the internet. </p>\n\n<p>After searching the internet for a solution I found one that involved opening gksudo, using gedit as root user and changing the text in the netowrkmanager config file IFUPDOWN Managed = False, from false to true.</p>\n\n<p>After this fix I was able to get the internet running, however every time I restarted the system the network would show as unmanaged, despite the config file still saying true. At this point we have to open gksudo, gedit as root user, open networkmanager config file, and save it again. This would make the network usable and allow access to the internet via a browser. This would also need to be repeated everytime the PC was re-booted. Whilst this was a little tedious it was a satisfying fix. However today my dad tried to use the software center and has found that this is showing up as not having a network connection, making it impossible to download any software. If anyone has any idea's what to do to fix this then please help, as so far this is baffling me. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance\nStephen</p>\n"},{"id":600918,"title":"etc/network/interface empty no internet connection","body":"<p>My internet connection has gone suddenly and I find my <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> is completely empty, I can't ping my router and <code>ifconfig</code> for <code>eth0</code> shows no ip address or broadcast address, I tried network manager but it can't find a network, I tried adding <code>eth0</code> to <code>ip4</code> with its address and dns address.

I thought i had some computer coding background but man was i wrong. Please help me with this! Im not even sure if the OS can recognize the ethernet port ( It was working fine when i had Windows on it prior to Ubuntu install, and is the port that came with the computer) and the internet is currently working with a ethernet wired PC in a different room.</p>\n"},{"id":110202,"title":"Network manager dies if my router drops the internet connection","body":"<p>My ISP doing some repairs on my broadband cable so my internet connection is dropping frequently, when my internet connection drops, Network Manager, shows that there are no interfaces.\nI have to restart network-manager using start and stop connections to get it working again.</p>\n\n<p>Using Ubuntu with KDE 4</p>\n"},{"id":123399,"title":"I keep losing the Internet connection in Ubuntu 11.10","body":"<p>I recently assembled a new desktop with an ASUS PCE-N15 wireless network adapter and my home wireless network is detected and I am able to connect to it and even access the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>However, after little time I lose the Internet connection, not the wireless connection to the home network, and have to manually disconnect and reconnect in order to get Internet working.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone has any ideas? </p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: /var/log/messages</p>\n\n<pre><code>Apr 19 13:46:50 videl kernel: [13415.875472] rtl8192c: Loading firmware file rtlwifi/rtl8192cfw.bin\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.833899] cfg80211: Calling CRDA to update world regulatory domain\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.913925] cfg80211: World regulatory domain updated:\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.913926] cfg80211:     (start_freq - end_freq @ bandwidth), (max_antenna_gain, max_eirp)\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.913927] cfg80211:     (2402000 KHz - 2472000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.913929] cfg80211:     (2457000 KHz - 2482000 KHz @ 20000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.913930] cfg80211:     (2474000 KHz - 2494000 KHz @ 20000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.913932] cfg80211:     (5170000 KHz - 5250000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\nApr 19 13:58:08 videl kernel: [14093.913933] cfg80211:     (5735000 KHz - 5835000 KHz @ 40000 KHz), (300 mBi, 2000 mBm)\nApr 19 13:58:13 videl kernel: [14098.456988] rtl8192c: Loading firmware file rtlwifi/rtl8192cfw.bin\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>UPDATE 2: The result of running <code>ip route list</code> with and without internet connection is the same:</p>\n\n<pre><code>default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlan0  proto static\n169.254.0.0/16 dev wlan0  scope link  metric 1000 \n192.168.1.0/24 dev wlan0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.7  metric 2 \n</code></pre>\n"}]}]
