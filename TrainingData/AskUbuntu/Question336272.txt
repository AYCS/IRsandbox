[{"id":336272,"title":"How is ubuntu live user graphical session (startx) started up in a LiveCD?","body":"<p>I am trying to build a custom ISO, using <code>ubuntu-builder</code>. I've taken a 12.40 mini remix ISO as a starting point. Here is my specific example - however, I'm interested in principle how the process goes (so I can apply that to other DE/WM).  </p>\n\n<p>when I run a new ISO, built directly from the mini remix starting ISO, all is as expected - I can run the new ISO in a virtual machine, and the boot process terminates with text-only prompt for the live <code>ubuntu</code> user. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I try to install LXDE (there is an entry for it in <code>ubuntu-builder</code>, apparently it installs <code>lxde-core</code> and X dependencies; and I manually have to install <code>lxterminal</code>, and as icons are missing, probably <code>lxde-icon-theme</code> as well). I have to also manually install <code>xinit</code>, so I have <code>startx</code>. But this, by itself, doesn't do much: if I boot this customized ISO in a virtual machine, the exact same thing happens as with the \"original\" ISO - boot process completes with a text mode prompt for <code>ubuntu</code> live user. </p>\n\n<p>If I now type <code>startx</code> at this prompt, then LXDE starts (running <code>startlxde</code> at this prompt will complain about X), such that when you start <code>lxterminal</code> from that desktop, it is started under the live <code>ubuntu</code> user.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization#Boot_init\" rel=\"nofollow\">LiveCDCustomization - Boot init</a>, it is mentioned:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Boot init<br>\n  You have to edit the files in edit/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/* For example you can change the hostname or the livecd user. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... but I don't exactly understand what is exactly being ran by what there. The <code>ubuntu-builder</code> unpacks these files under <code>/home/ubuntu-builder/FileSystem/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/</code> - but as far as I can see, most of these just run some inline <code>sed</code> commands, I cannot see much executive commands there? </p>\n\n<p>Still, I tried to copy one of the scripts there as a new script, <code>51startx</code>, which in the executable section has:</p>\n\n<pre><code>log_begin_msg \"$DESCRIPTION\"\n\nchroot /root startx\nchroot /root startlxde\n\nlog_end_msg\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This does absolutely nothing - again, after boot, I get the usual text prompt <code>ubuntu@ubuntu:~$</code>. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Then I found <a href=\"http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/showthread.php?t=40457\" rel=\"nofollow\">Modify: Startx automatically, add apt, etc - backtrack-linux.org</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To have a graphical login, just install gdm and run it in startup:</p>\n\n<pre>aptitude update\naptitude install gdm</pre>\n  \n  <p>Then, edit /etc/rc.local, and add a line BEFORE \"exit 0\" like this:</p>\n\n<pre>service gdm start</pre>\n  \n  <p>This is not the best way, but run! .

One thing that is certain among all guides is that the customization needs to be done in the <code>casper</code> initial (ram?) system.
