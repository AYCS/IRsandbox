My cursor always moves to the upper right-hand corner where the power cog is every time I touch my touchpad even in 1/10 second. After that,I can move it with a mouse but cannot click everywhere, just move and move. I can only use a mouse normally when the system was restarted and I didn't touch the touchpad at all, because when I touch it, I can only move the cursor again. How can I fix this?</p>\n"}]}]
