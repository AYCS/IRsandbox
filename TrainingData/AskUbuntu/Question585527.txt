The short story here is that ttf-mscorefonts-install is broken and is completely constipating the process of trying to install or uninstall anything else. I have been trying various things listed in various forums to uninstall the database, clean the database, reinstall, uninstall and then reinstall, etc.  None of these work. What I always come back to is a dpkg error that looks like this:</p>\n\n<p>dpkg: error processing package ttf-mscorefonts-installer (--configure):\n package ttf-mscorefonts-installer is not ready for configuration\n cannot configure (current status 'half-installed')</p>\n\n<p>After trying the various apt-get clean, update, and remove options I finally get the message that:</p>\n\n<p>Testo@Testbox01:~$ apt-get remove ttf-mscorefonts-install\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?</p>\n\n<p>So now the database is locked up and I'll have to reboot - again - to unlock it.</p>\n\n<p>So here is my question - how can I manually rip out ttf-mscorefonts-install and its dependencies by the roots so that they no longer infect the rest of the installed products database? What are the files that should be removed and where are they? What files need to be changed or altered to make this process work?</p>\n\n<p>This has become frustrating in the extreme, and I'm almost to the point of deleting Ubuntu entirely and going back to Windoze, which is exactly what I originally wanted to get away from.  But if I can't install or uninstall anything going forward, then Ubuntu is basically useless to me.</p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping that someone can shed some light on this. </p>\n\n<p>I don't know if the tags on this article are optimal, but the system tells me that I must have at least a 300 reputation (whatever that is) to put in the tags I wanted, otherwise I must use what it offers. It won't even let me use tff-mscorefonts-install as a tag, which is the crux of this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,\nMike Martin</p>\n"},{"id":638687,"title":"Installing Blackmagic Mini Monitor fails","body":"<p>I have a Blackmagic card which has the following instructions </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Desktop Video packages require some additional libraries and packages:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>dkms</li>\n  <li>Linux kernel headers/source (for currently running kernel version)</li>\n  <li>Qt 4.5 or later\n  Ubuntu and Debian based distributions\n  The deb packages are located in the deb/i386 and deb/amd64\n  directories.
