[{"id":715055,"title":"Ubuntu support for 5K (Dell UP2715K): adjusting details","body":"<p>I've recently purchased a Dell UP2715K which has a resolution of 5120x2880 and have installed ubuntu 15.10 to go with it. The UP2715K is connected to a GeForce 960 GTX (2 displayport cables since 1 cable alone would not handle the bandwidth), and as such the display is actually seen as two 2560x2880 monitors, hardware-wise.</p>\n\n<p>Ubuntu installs just fine, and after installing nvidia drivers the display ran at its native 5K resolution + HiDPI scaling works, and the image is just wonderful. However, ubuntu still seems to think there are two displays for a few purposes, and I still have two small issues: </p>\n\n<p>-> top menus don't go across the whole screen </p>\n\n<p>-> maximizing windows only leads to them occupying one side of the screen </p>\n\n<p>Question is: How can I fix these issues? Is there any way the OS will really only see one big 5120x2880 screen?... I tried poking around with display settings + nvidia configs but didn't manage so far...</p>\n\n<p><em>Edit: Unfortunately the maximization issue also means I cannot view content such as netflix in true fullscreen... which is rather frustrating.

Everything still looks crisp and sharp, no complaints on that front.</p>\n\n<p>My issue is i have to have a custom script loaded when ubuntu starts that changes the resolution from 3200 to 1920 so when i log in i have to wait for the resolution to change before i log in or else the resolution will stay at 3200 and then i have to change it manually.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is there any way to remove the actual 3200x1800 resolution from even being an option?</p>\n\n<p>Another small issue i run into is, i use an external monitor(1920x1080) sometimes and when i unlpug the hdmi cable, my desktop on my laptop screen reverts back to 3200 resolution.</p>\n\n<p>I basically want to fool ubuntu into thinking that the highest resolution to choose from is 1920x1080. Is this possible?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long winded question :)</p>\n"},{"id":226455,"title":"Using DisplayPort with ThinkPad and DockingStation does not work","body":"<p>I have a ThinkPad x230 in a Mini Dock Plus.
