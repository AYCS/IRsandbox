So it's not supported...  But there are many elements I have questions for.   First off, the phone has a setting to choose from which of the two sim cards to use.  And then the prop editor built into it can make the phone say it's something that its not.  Such as swapping the build.prop with the prop of another device,  by just bluetooth detection.  It has an extended antenna that sticks out for extended range, I'm assuming.  It has 16Gb of space.  It has a separate memory space For the system.  It even has 2gigs of swap that isn't on the 16 gigs of space.  The screen resolution sucks and the camera sucks too.  But the cpu power is crazy.  It claims it has 1.5ghz and 1024mb of ram.  I could run three game boys and game link them via bluetooth to this phone as the server while using bluetooth connection to a wiimote for a controller while running Spotify.  It has 2 headphone jacks and 2 mini USB ports.  One port is in plain sight while the other is underneath the battery cover.
