I integrated my Google account with it. But every time I login GNOME asks for my google account password. But when I give it, it simply wont accept it! I am 100% sure I am typing the right password for my google account(It doesn't have 2 step verification at present. I was using it before but not now.) Since it didn't work I tried my login password but that too didn't work. Then I removed integration for that account from \"Online Accounts\" then removed all my cache and tried integrating again. It integrates, but again, if I type in my password when asked for, the same issue persists.

I have been able to get most things up and running fairly well.</p>\n\n<p>This is where I am having problems. I installed Ubuntu-gnome as I have found gnome to be more accessible than Unity. It is installed on my laptop in an encrypted volume. My problems are from the login. With some sited assistance I have figured out how to get to the login screen, but have problems logging in. From what I am told, it appears to be a command line login. I installed speakup to try to access it but could not get it to work. It will start speaking but just reads off a few lines and stops. It says something about trying to connect to pulse audio and then tries to connect to a few other similar things before it stops speaking. I think it is just because speakup needs to be configured, but I can not figure out how to do that.</p>\n\n<p>I guess the heart of my question is this:</p>\n\n<p>A.
