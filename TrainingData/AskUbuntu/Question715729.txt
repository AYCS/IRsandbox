Even if I press up and down keys to \"prevent\" the timer, it still goes straight into Ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>This laptop does have UEFI and I think it's something to do with that that prevents GRUB to load, however I could be wrong. The only way I can make Ubuntu to load is UEFI on and Safe Mode off. Leagcy Mode or anyother changes to the system does not allow me to boot either OS.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone can help out, I would be very grateful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 12/03/2015</strong></p>\n\n<p>I didn't have time (silly as it sounds) to try to address the issue, i.e. try boot repair or other ideas. However on the 12/03/2015 I had a software update through Ubuntu Update Centre and from then on, I was able to load up the GRUB menu and load Windows 7. However there are some issues that happen now and then.</p>\n\n<p>A purple screen with white lines when I attempt to load Windows 7 and then crashes sometimes occurs. Once the a memory crash dump occurred as logging into a profile once happened. I'm not sure how to respond to these issues but I'm sure I can fix this, unless someone finds an answer before me.</p>\n"},{"id":550638,"title":"Ubuntu 14.04 Wireless not working properly in Dell Inspiron N5110","body":"<p>Recently i have upgraded my PC to Ubuntu 14.04.
