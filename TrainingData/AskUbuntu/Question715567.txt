[{"id":715567,"title":"Dual-boot on new computer with SSD","body":"<p>This is a basic question.  I have found a lot of material on SSD's and dual-booting, but they are about set-ups that are much more nuanced than what I'm interested in.  My question is simply this: if I buy a new computer that has an SSD, does it introduce any problems for dual-booting compared to a traditional hard-drive?</p>\n\n<p>I've seen stuff on HDD+SSD, which I assume relates to using one drive to hold boot files and the OS, and the other to hold data.  That sounds too complicated and I don't want to do that. </p>\n\n<p>I want to run Windows and Ubuntu on the same machine.  I read that SSD's provide massive performance gains, so I'd like to purchase a laptop with an SSD.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":680812,"title":"Dual-boot Ubuntu / Windows 10 on SSD + HDD","body":"<p><em>Hi there, newbie here !</em></p>\n\n<p>I'm going to have a 256 GB SSD very soon (mSATA 850 EVO) to accompany my 1 TB HDD (7.2k TPM) on a laptop, and I want to take advantage of this to format the HDD (with obvious backup of the data I want to keep).</p>\n\n<p>This is the first time I will have Linux on my own PC (mostly for studies in computer science), the first time I try Windows 10, that I have a SSD, and my first dual boot !</p>\n\n<p>So I took a long time reading tutorials, documentation and such, and came up with something like this to set all my things up :</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>SSD :</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Windows OS and most (probably all) programs and games : NTFS (210 GB)</li>\n<li>Ubuntu\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>/</code> : ext4 (20 GB)</li>\n<li><code>/usr</code> : ext4 (15 GB)</li>\n<li><code>/boot/efi</code> : ext4 (250 MB)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>HDD :</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data (music, vids, photos, movies, documents) : NTFS (700 GB)</li>\n<li>AltPrograms (if SSD runs out of space) : NTFS (100 GB)</li>\n<li>Ubuntu\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>swap</code> : none (8 GB)</li>\n<li><code>/var</code> : ext4 (3 GB)</li>\n<li><code>/tmp</code> : ext4 (8 GB)</li>\n<li><code>/home</code> : ext4 (50 GB)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Basically, what I want to do here is drastically increase my system's performance and take care of my SSD for maximum longevity (limit the write cycles).

I have 30GB of free space on the SSD and 200GB on the HDD. Now what partitions should I create? </p>\n\n<p>I really have no idea how the file system in ubuntu works. I have been reading a lot and got a lot of conflicting information. </p>\n\n<p>In Windows I use the SSD for the OS and smaller programs and the HDD for bigger programs, games and other large files. I want to do it similarly for ubuntu. I also want to be able to exchange files between Windows and ubuntu without them interfering.</p>\n\n<p>So obviously /root should go on the SSD, as that takes most advantage of the SSD's speed? How big should /root be?</p>\n\n<p>I seem to also need a /home partition. Where should I put that, if some of my programs should go on the SSD and some on the HDD? Is it possible to \"split\" /home between both? Or can I install programs outside of home? If yes, what would the disadvantages of that be? Should I install programs on home at all or is it simply the ubuntu equivalent to Windows' Appdata, and programs themselves should go somewhere completely different?</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, what about swap? A lot of conflicting information on that. Some say you don't need it at all, some say it should be a fixed size, some say it needs to be more, the more ram you have. I have 8GB ram, which I almost never fully use and I do not plan on ever hibernating. </p>\n\n<p>So as I understand it, swap is basically a reserve for when your ram is all in use. What's the worst thing that can happen, if I don't have swap? And why would it need to be larger if I have MORE ram? Shouldn't I need LESS \"reserve\", if I already have more \"actual ram\"? Also, why do I need an extra partition anyway? AFAIK windows simply uses a normal file pagefile.sys on the normal partition, which can easily be changed in size. What's the advantage of having an extra partition?</p>\n\n<p>Also, if I do need swap, where should I put it? Some sources they it wears out the SSD much more quickly, others say that won't be a problem for over 20 years and swap benefits hugely from being on the SSD.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if my questions sound stupid, I'm long-term Windows user, who was just convinced to try ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can give a ubuntu beginner!</p>\n"},{"id":327575,"title":"Dual Boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu with SSD and HDD","body":"<p>So I have an Acer laptop that has both an HDD and SSD.
