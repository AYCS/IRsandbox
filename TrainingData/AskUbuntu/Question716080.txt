I have a new Sony Vaio Pro 13 (so, it's an ultra-book WITHOUT the CD drive), which had Windows 8 pre installed. I needed to install Ubuntu in dual boot for university purposes. So, I shrunk the Windows partition and created a new partition, and from a boot-able USB stick I created a swap partition and an ext4 partition, and installed Ubuntu. Due to several failures, I used the Boot-repair tool, which installed the grub 2 boot-loader, from which I could start Ubuntu and Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway Ubuntu didn't start, it showed me an error, but this is not the problem. The problem is that, due to this error, I decided to try again (because maybe I did something wrong), so I logged into windows and deleted the two Linux partitions, creating an unallocated space, and rebooted with the USB stick.
