I figured converting to SSD would definitely improve performance and allow me to run tasks faster, and using Ubuntu which is a far simpler platform to Windows 7 I'd browse the web at superb speeds efficiently, and running Wine I'd be able to open Word and Excel and run my files off a cloud service despite the lack of storage space. </p>\n\n<p>What does everyone else think?
