In short I want to be able to plug this device into any computer (specifically using EFI but BIOS support is also nice) and run a full Ubuntu distro with all of my personal files and applications on it. I recently have used the mkusb code from another post to try to accomplish this and while it was the closest to what I wanted it was only a persistent version of a Live disk (in other words it was a demo set up to run like a full os.) It was interesting, though, because it made me wonder that if there was a full iso file for the code to use instead of the Live USB iso will it create a persistent, full, boot-able, drive, or (with my current luck) end up being a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>I have currently looked at nearly every main break off post similar to my question but I have not found an answer.

This EFI capable system can not boot Ubuntu or any other installation media using EFI with the only exception being Windows installation media.

There appears to be no explanation online (that I have found so far) that goes anywhere near describing how and why this happens.</p>\n\n<p>The accepted way of installing Ubuntu to an EFI system is apparently switched off EFI and install in legacy mode which involves creating a bios-grub partition before commencing or let boot-repair to do the fix after installing Ubuntu in legacy mode.  Boot Repair detects EFI system and creates the bios_grub partition and installs grub-efi.  </p>\n\n<p>So after getting Ubuntu and Windows booting using EFI I noticed the grub_bios partition was still in existence so i removed it with gdisk and still have Windows and Ubuntu booting.</p>\n\n<p>Why doesn't boot-repair delete bios_grub partition after installing grub-efi?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>14/08/2013 UPDATE:</em></strong> After installing rEFInd boot-repair cd now boots EFI mode.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is bios_grub some kind of MBR partition?

I downloaded the <code>ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso</code> and DD'd it to a flash drive, but my old macbook wouldn't read it (no valid filesystem sort of thing).  I tried burning it to a DVD, same issue; if I tried to boot it while holding down the option key, the laptop would literally spit out the DVD before even booting up, and then show just its own disk.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally I did some googling, and found <a href=\"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2094075\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2094075</a>.  Basically, the .iso is packaged weirdly and mac doesn't like it.  So I tried the instructions mentioned on that page (<code>dd if=/disk/rdiskNs1 of=./ubuntu-reg_iso.iso bs=1m</code>); that resulted in an image with one small partition that I can mount, which contains <code>/efi/boot/bootx64.efi,grubx64.efi</code>.  Assuming the other partition was simply hidden and would be available to the EFI bootloader, I burned this to a DVD.  (BTW I'm doing all these things on a mid 2010 macbook pro running OS X.8.5, not on the old machine.) But when I restart the macbook holding down the option key, it doesn't give me the option to boot off of the DVD.</p>\n\n<p>I also followed the instructions here: <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/153833/why-cant-i-mount-the-ubuntu-12-04-installer-isos-in-mac-os-x\">Why can&#39;t I mount the Ubuntu 12.04 installer ISOs in Mac OS X?</a> and used Keka to extract the original .iso, so I have its contents:</p>\n\n<pre><code>EFI/    \nMaster.cdr    \nREADME.diskdefines    \n[BOOT]/    \nautorun.inf    \nboot/    \ncasper/    \ndists/    \ninstall/    \nisolinux/    \nmd5sum.txt    \npics/    \npool/    \npreseed/    \nwubi.exe\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But I assume I can't just stick all those in a new .iso and burn that; there's some formatting that has to be done.
