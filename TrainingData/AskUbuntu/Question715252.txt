[{"id":715252,"title":"Having a lot of trouble converting a simple iso","body":"<p>Im not new to computers. Ive worked at IBM for several years. I am trying to help a friend convert an ISO file to an IMG so he can install bootcamp on his (Mid) 2010 macbook pro. I have had Absolutely NO luck with any forms or Q&amp;A. I have used The terminal and disk utility. I have done this before using a 16GB flash drive. But there is no option to do so on his computer. I have searched this website  and a large number of other websites back and front for litterally hours. EVERY LAST Q&amp;A HAS DONE <strong>NOTHING</strong>. If someone can help that would be nice. Does mac really suck this bad?
