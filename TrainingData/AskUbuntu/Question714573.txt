But whenever I click the button to grant access, it reverts back to \"off\" after maybe three seconds. What's happening and how can I solve this?</p>\n\n<p>P.S.\nI already tried using Pidgin but I still get the same error.  Sometimes I get the \"authorization failed\" error as well.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I can log into my FB account using my web browser.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":309521,"title":"Empathy will not authorize facebook account","body":"<p>Short and sweet:\nI can not get Empathy to add facebook as an account.

Whenever I create an account using this plugin, after pidgin logs into the facebook account, automatically my last 50 or so facebook chats open up in the chat-boxes. This freezes pidgin up for a while. This seems like a bug. I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 and plugin version is <code>purple-facebook_20150915~4f84a8a</code>.

Everything was working alright, until today, when I couldn't connect to one of my accounts. A <code>Server closed the connection</code> error was being displayed. My other account could log-in from pidgin just fine. But just a moment ago that other account as well failed to connect to facebook displaying an <code>Internal server error</code>. Did facebook completely withdraw support for XMPP chat? In that case is there any way to chat on facebook using pidgin or any other third party software?</p>\n"},{"id":622569,"title":"Empathy Facebook Stopped Working,No Account Settings","body":"<p>I had to do a ctrl-alt-f1 log out,because I was stuck between workspaces(ugh),When I rebooted I forgot to add \"noapic\" to my cmd line to fix MP-BIOS I/O Timer Bug(ugh),the system boots with or without it,but I've always used it to be safe.\nWhen I clicked to open Empathy it said \"You Need To Set Up An Account To See Contacts Here\",when I had already setup my FB/Empathy account in System Settings.\nClicking the Account Settings button does nothing,and in System Settings the Empathy on/off slider is missing from my list.\nI have already done a purge uninstall and reinstall of Empathy,but this has literally changed nothing.\nEmpathy is one of my favorite things about Ubuntu,and no I have not yet tried Pidgin,because I thoroughly enjoy Empathy.\nSomeone PLEASE help me.\nMy system is an HP Media Server AMD Athlon64x2 with 2 GB DDR2,Using Nvidia 304 Proprietary Drivers.Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit.\nLet me know anyting else I can provide.</p>\n"},{"id":481792,"title":"Regarding Facebook messages and Pidgin","body":"<p>This question seems to be kind of difficult to explain, so I haven't been able to find the answers anywhere for lack of search terms that I can think of.  And maybe most people don't consider it a problem anyway.  </p>\n\n<p>But when I'm on Facebook, and I have something like Pidgin connected for my messages, I still can't be scrolling down my Facebook news feed without having message boxes popping up in front of what I'm doing.  How can I make message notifications only go to the app I'm using for receiving them?  It gets incredibly annoying, and kind of defeats the purpose of having these applications in the first place if Facebook is still going to personally nag me about my messages.</p>\n\n<p>I can go into chat and \"Turn of Chat\", but I still get a little red message icon when something new comes through, in the top right (and in this case, I believe my friends see me as appearing offline, even though I'm responding to them).  Perhaps you don't consider this much of a problem, but I consider it a deep enough annoyance to not make it worth using these programs.  Does anybody know any good way to make Facebook just let Pidgin handle my messages?  Perhaps a browser extension that removes the messaging capabilities from the browser version of Facebook or something? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"id":449104,"title":"Empathy won&#39;t connect to my Facebook account","body":"<p>When I try to connect Empathy to my Facebook account, the following error appears:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UqzxS.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n\n<p>Rough translation: \"Error connecting to the app. Sorry, but the app you are trying to access doesn't exist or was deactivated.\"</p>\n\n<p>What can I do to solve it?</p>\n"},{"id":446115,"title":"Adding Facebook Online Account - &quot;application you are trying to use doesn&#39;t exist or has been disabled&quot;","body":"<p>I noticed on April 9 that Empathy wasn't connecting to Facebook Chat, so I opened Online Accounts, and it appears that I needed to authorize Ubuntu to access Facebook.
