So I switched to alternative players.<br>\nVideo playing was fine, but I could not run some on-line games that needed newer Shockwave Flash. \nI also tried Chrome for these games, it started but got stuck in the middle.<br>\nI did not removed Shockwave plugin, just disabled it and got it out of my mind,</p>\n\n<p>...until the middle of January, when Shockwave updater suddenly notified me about a new critical security update.<br>\nSo I installed Pepperflash which gave me <strong>version 16.0 which is now updated to version 17.0</strong>, as recommended by Adobe Security Bulletin.  </p>\n\n<p>About week later with another update I looked at the <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-01.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe Security Bulletin</a>  again. Now it was recommending version 11.2 for Linux. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe they were so hurry to fix the critical problem that forgot about not updating Linux version, but then fixed it, I do not know. </p>\n\n<p>Since then everything working, including games.<br>\nThe version 11.2 was not removed.<br>\nNow I have 2 Shockwave plugins, and they keep updating.\nVersion 16.0 recently updated to 17.0.0.134, and another one to 11.2.202.451.<br>\n  <em>I prepared a screenshot to post here, but I do not have enough reputation to post images.</em><br>\nI disable version 11.2, but sometimes it get enabled by itself.  I suspect updates do it.<br>\nOfficial <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-05.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adobe page</a> suggests version 11.2 for Linux, as before.</p>\n\n<p>My questions are:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is it safe to use?   </li>\n<li>If yes, maybe it is good idea to copy recent Linux Shockwave flash from my computer and spread in the world? I need instructions how to do it for Ubuntu 14.04.</li>\n<li>If it is not safe, what about using it just for some games sites? </li>\n<li>Should I remove version 11.2?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>UPD1:</strong><br>\nI am sorry I did not explained it well. \nI have Firefox running on Ubuntu, and it has 2 plugins named Shockwave Flash:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Shockwave FlashShockwave Flash 17.0 r0   </li>\n<li>Shockwave FlashShockwave Flash 11.2 r202.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It was copy/paste from FF add-ons page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upd2:</strong><br>\nI did more research. Well, I was so wrong!<br>\nThe file of \"Shockwave FlashShockwave Flash 17.0 r0\" is libfreshwrapper-pepperflash.so.<br>\nSo I do have PepperFlash and Adobe Flash.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>$ dpkg --get-selections | grep flash\nadobe-flash-properties-gtk          install\nadobe-flashplugin               install\nflashplugin-installer               deinstall\npepperflashplugin-nonfree           install\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>They probably updated at the same day,  so I thought both plugins are from Adobe.\nIt must be the PepperFlash that make the games to work.<br>\nTo add more confusion, Firefox plugin page calls it \"Adobe Flash Player  Shockwave Flash 17.0 r0\".  </p>\n\n<p>The only question that remains is:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do I need both Shockwave Flashes?</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"id":513926,"title":"Problems watching pay-for-view streaming content","body":"<p>I am using Xubuntu 14.04 with Firefox 31 as my browser.
