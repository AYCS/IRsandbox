Logical Types When Using Manual Partitioning At Ubuntu Installation","body":"<p>I am very new to Ubuntu, and I apologize beforehand if my terminology is incorrect.  I'm constantly learning new things with all of this! I am working with Ubuntu 14.04 (I believe.) LTS. </p>\n\n<p>I read very thorough instructions for using manual partitioning at Ubuntu installation titled: \"How to Use Manual Partitioning During Installation?\" Although I found this extremely helpful (even the additional comments), I am still confused about part of this process.  </p>\n\n<p>In the steps for using manual partitioning on a clean disk, it was recommended to assign the \"/\" root fs as logical.  However, at the end of the instructions, it was suggested that for MBR scheme disks \"/\" root fs be assigned as primary.  </p>\n\n<p>The computer I am working on did, at one point, have an MBR partition set-up on it.  However, after several mishaps, the partitions that were automatically placed, were wiped out.  From what I can tell, the hard disk no longer has any such partitions. </p>\n\n<p>My questions are in regards to the \"/\" root fs partition, the (optional) \"/boot\" partition, the \"/tmp\" partition, and the \"/var\" partition.  In the step-by-step instructions that I read, initially it was instructed to set \"/\" root fs to logical. Later it was recommended to set this partition to primary for MBR schemed disks. </p>\n\n<p>Given my hard disks current state, am I better off (or is it recommended) to set \"/\" root fs as primary or logical?  Could anyone please explain (in a way I might easily understand) the difference between primary and logical partition types?
