Thereto change left channel to 1 (first player) and right channel to 2 (second player). The channel numbers represent the players ingame. Player 1: Blue, Player 2: Red, Player 3: Green and so on.</li>\n<li>Check if players numbers 1 and 2 aren't selected at any other soundcard to avoid multiple inputs.</li>\n<li>Each player should just be assigned once. Scroll through the whole soundcard list to ensure that.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Such a pain.
