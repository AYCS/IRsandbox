I didn't have any USBs or blank CDs, so I made it boot from my extra D drive. Now when I turn on my computer, it automatically boots into Ubuntu for some reason and I have no option to get back into Windows. I can press shift on the grub and get into the thing that say boot: but I don't know what to type to make Windows boot. </p>\n\n<p>I'd be fine with not getting back into Windows if Ubuntu would install, but it gives me an error every time I try to install it, so I assume doing it from the CD drive just isn't going to work or something and I need to get back into Windows and undo what I did to my D drive and wait until I get a USB to do it with. But the first problem I have to deal with is how am I supposed to get back into Windows? Right now I can't get into any OS except for Ubuntu's Live Version.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I don't think my computer even recognizes Windows 7 is on it any longer. When Ubuntu tries to install, I don't get the \"Install Alongside Windows 7\" or \"Replace Windows 7 with Ubuntu\" (not the exact wording, I know) options, Windows 7 doesn't show up anywhere at all. It's just gone. And I don't see a second hard drive in my laptop, so I think maybe I changed the hard drive itself to an Ubuntu ISO installer. I'm really not sounding like the brightest person right now, I know. When I click on \"OS\" in Ubuntu Live Version, though, it still has all the Windows files and all the folders from my old C drive from Windows 7. I really don't know what's going on. At this point it looks like the only plausible option is to just take this hard drive out and replace with with a hard drive from my other laptop. </p>\n"},{"id":151908,"title":"How do I make a Live USB without destroying my Windows computer?","body":"<p>Unlike every other post I have read, let me begin by saying that I am TERRIFIED of destroying my Windows 7 home system in the attempt of making a bootable Ubuntu Thumb Drive.
