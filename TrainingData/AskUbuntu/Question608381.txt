Inside, it has a Qualcomm Atheros AR956x wireless card. I have networking turned on, but wireless is off. when I go to turn it on, it almost immediately goes back over to the right. there is a wireless \"switch\" (if you would even call it that) on my laptop, which is toggled with the Fn and F3 keys; it doesn't seem to do anything in Ubuntu, and there is no light to show me if it did do something or not. I can connect to networks using a wired connection, however this laptop is supposed to be for school, so that isn't really feasible to always be using a wired connection. The wireless does work with windows 10 which I have on dual boot, but I really want Linux to work. </p>\n\n<p>as for what I've tried, I don't remember everything I've tried in the past few hours, but what I have tried, I found that there seems to be a hard block for the wireless, I have tried using rfkill or something like that to get rid of the hard block, but it (obviously) didn't work. Another thing I have tried was going into the etc files to the blacklist.conf file and putting in wmi or something to blacklist it. again it (obviously) didn't work, saying that I can't modify that file. </p>\n\n<p>I should probably note that this is my first time really using Linux, so I don't exactly know what I'm doing, hence the crap ton of \"or something\"'s above. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: <code>lspci -nnk | grep 0280 -A2</code> output is <code>02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Quallcomm Atheros QCA9565 / AR9565 Wireless Network Adapter [168c:0036] (rev 01)\nSubsystem: Lite-On Communications Inc Device [11ad:0642]\nKernel driver in use: ath9k</code></p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: <code>rfkill list</code> output is <code>0: phy0: Wireless LAN\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: yes\n2: acer-bluetooth: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: yes\nHard blocked: no\n3: hci0: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: yes\nHard blocked: no</code></p>\n\n<p>I have turned off Bluetooth as I am not using it. wifi won't work with Bluetooth on or off. </p>\n"},{"id":630095,"title":"Qualcomm Atheros ar9227 wireless network adapter [168c:002d] (rev 1) does not work properly","body":"<p>I installed ubuntu 14.04 and the internet does not work properly,it can detect and connect to networks but it loads web pages very slowly and sometimes it doesn't even load at all, and I always get disconnected.
