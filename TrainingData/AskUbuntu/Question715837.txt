What I want to do is to have it run emulators of my old games, and I can get the emulators for linux just fine. The thing is, I want it to be like those all in one consoles you sometimes see. Where I will push the power button, pc starts up and a HUB pops up where I can choose which console I want to run (for example between playstation or sega dreamcast or super nintendo.) Then it loads up a menu of what games from that to choose from, I hit start on the controller and it starts. If There is some what to do that (or if MAME can somehow do that with these emulators or roms) with a controller only, that would be great.</p>\n\n<p>If this is not possible, what would be the next easiest thing to do? Also which version of linux would be recommended for just this?</p>\n"},{"id":632273,"title":"Will my Steam play be available on Linux?","body":"<p>So right now I have Steam on Windows 8.1. I already looked it up and apparently Steam actually is available for Ubuntu. I am planning on dual booting Ubuntu but to make things easier I will just put Steam on Ubuntu.

I know a lot of games are only available for Windows, the ones I play being Skyrim and Battlefield. Would I still be able to play those games using WINE? Or would I be better off using Windows? I have not installed any OS yet, and I don't plan on pirating Windows to run the two operating systems side by side. It would either be Ubuntu or Windows. Not both. So, please help?</p>\n"},{"id":415026,"title":"Windows Games how do i code in to play on linux","body":"<p>I Really want to switch to linux but i own a crap ton of windows games. and i would want to play them on my machine. is there anyway possible to play the newest titles on said ubuntu machine? like what code would i need and how do i implement it.</p>\n"},{"id":281160,"title":"Running Age of Empires 2 in Linux","body":"<p>I've been recently trying to play Age of Empires 2 on my Linux Ubuntu 12.04 LTS computer. However, I can't seem to get it to work with any method i found on the computer. I've tried Playonlinux, however, when i try to play it, a message comes up saying that there has been an internal error. I've also tried doing it though virtualbox and installing it onto a virtual version of windows xp. However, after it completes the install, it tell me that there is no CD in the disk drive and that I should insert it and restart the application. If anyone has a way I haven't tried yet or something that I could have missed please let me know.
