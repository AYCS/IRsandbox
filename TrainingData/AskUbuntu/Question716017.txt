It may suddenly disconnect when I'm editing a Google Docs file, when I'm cleaning my files or when I've walked away and the laptop is idle; it just seems to randomly disconnect all the time. This can greatly vary from a minute or so after booting to a few hours later. Rebooting usually fixes the problem and connects me back. I'm running Lubuntu 14.10.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as it disconnects, the network indicator doesn't change. Clicking on it still brings up a list of all the nearby networks. If I ask it to disconnect from the network, the indicator icon will change to a \"Wifi not connected\" icon, however it will still display the networks nearby. If I click to reconnect to my Wi-fi network, it will not reconnect, and the indicator icon will not change. After a while it will change to saying \"Wireless is disabled\" and won't display the nearby networks. It will stay like this until I reboot. I haven't tested to see if it is still searching for networks and displaying them or if it still remembers the names and displays them. Also, as soon as it disconnects, I'm not sure if the actual OS realises that it has disconnected or whether it is just the indicator which doesn't change.</p>\n\n<p>This doens't occur when I'm actively using the internet. (e.g. Downloading a file, streaming a video)</p>\n\n<p>I originally thought this was due to the new wireless modem I bought, as my phone (Nexus 5) also experienceds a similar problem.

I can turn wifi off and connect to cellular data, then re-enable wifi and it'll be fine. This only happens when my phone is connected to the 2.4Ghz network though) I then realised it was only my two devices which experience this problem, and maybe the two problems are not linked. I also think this because when I do <code>sudo iwlist scan</code> after it disconnects, it says:</p>\n\n<pre><code>wlan0     Interface doesn't support scanning : Network is down\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have put the full output of <code>sudo iwlist scan</code> and <code>iwconfig</code> on <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/3Ldp64mP\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pastebin</a> if this helps.</p>\n\n<p>I also <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/425155/my-wireless-wifi-connection-does-not-work-what-information-is-needed-to-diagnos/425205#425205\">ran the Wi-Fi Diagnosis tool</a> and put the result on <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/7BaeAHUQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pastebin</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://pastebin.com/gkeyQi91\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a>'s the syslog before I disabled the N protocol.</p>\n\n<p>I disabled the N protocol as @shaddy suggested but the Wi-Fi still disconnected.
