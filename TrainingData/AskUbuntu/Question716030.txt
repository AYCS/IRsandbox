[{"id":716030,"title":"How to leave hardcoded subtitles unchanged when resizing videos using Handbrake","body":"<p>Well, the title basically says it all.  I was trying to resize a video using Handbrake (it worked BTW, video and audio was synced and smooth as can be) but when I got the re-sized video, the hardcoded subtitles were messed up and didn't appear anymore.  All I got was the word \"intro\" as the subtitle for the entire video. I was thinking maybe there was something I needed to do during the resizing to prevent this outcome.  I already did some googling but failed to find any solution.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":714591,"title":"How to resize 720p videos to 480p using Handbrake","body":"<p>Can anyone provide me a step-by-step process on how to change a video's resolution from 720p to 480p using Handbrake?

I must be doing something wrong because every time I change the resolution, the audio of the video becomes out of sync and the video itself stutters. :[</p>\n"},{"id":639250,"title":"MTS video files - how to merge and convert multiple files","body":"<p>I have just recorded a video using my Sony video camera.\nIt is splited in 4 files (2.1 GB for each file). \nI'd like to merge them and convert the resulting file to another format (smaller size).</p>\n\n<p>What software could I use?
