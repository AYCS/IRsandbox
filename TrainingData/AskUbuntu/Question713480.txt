[{"id":713480,"title":"Expanding space of a partition containing bootloader with gparted - how do I move the free space so that it safely can be done?","body":"<p>I've got a problem on my hands. My disk contains /dev/sda1 which is my Ubuntu partition, /dev/sda2 which is an NTFS partition, then comes the unallocated space which I want to use to expand the next partition which is /dev/sda3 that contains a Windoze install, along with a /boot flag. The last partition is the Linux swap partition.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of my partition layout, for an easier overlooking perspective: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/NGn1gVf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/NGn1gVf.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>Now, the problem is that the unallocated space is in between two partitions. I guess I must move the unallocated space to the right somehow, if it can be done, or move the sda2 NTFS partition to the left of the unallocated space, which Gparted warns me not to do:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moving a partition might cause your operating system to fail to boot.\n  You have queued an operation to move the start sector of partition\n  /dev/sda3.  Failure to boot is most likely to occur if you move the\n  GNU/Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows\n  system partition C:.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm sure there is a simple solution to this, if so, please educate me. I'm not sure of what to do. My goal is to expand the sda3 NTFS partition to include the unallocated space, while not messing up the bootloader. That's all.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance!

I seem to have a bit of a problem with my partitions.
