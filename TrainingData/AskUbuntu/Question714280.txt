[{"id":714280,"title":"Ubuntu thinks my Audient iD14 audio interface is Analogue Surround 4.0 when it&#39;s actually stereo. Is there any way to fix this?","body":"<p>I'm using an external Audient iD14 audio interface with a Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04 dual boot system. I mainly use Windows for FL Studio and the Adobe Creative Suite, but I like to mess around with Ubuntu from time to time, especially for programming. Everything works great except that for some reason, Ubuntu lists my audio interface as Analogue Surround 4.0 when it actually only plays in stereo. As a result, the audio plays louder in the right channel than the left channel. While I can get it to work by adjusting the balance with the slider, it still sounds a little off. It's not bad, but it just doesn't sound as good as it does on Windows. So is there any way to force Ubuntu to treat sound devices as stereo? I know the problem might be that there are no Audient device drivers for Linux, but I wanted to make sure before I just accept to live with slightly poorer audio quality.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":464388,"title":"No sound from laptop speakers in Ubuntu 14.04 after booting into Windows 8.1","body":"<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7537.</p>\n\n<p>I had installed 14.04 on it, and had no problems with the sound initially. However, like my with ethernet card, it seemed expecting to not have driver/software issues in linux was unrealistic.</p>\n\n<p>I purchased an SSD for the laptop and installed Ubuntu 14.04 on that. Then, I used gparted to copy over the windows partition from the disk that came with the laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Everything still worked just fine, until I booted into Windows 8.1. The sound worked fine while I was in Windows, but after rebooting the laptop, and going back into Ubuntu, the sound stopped working through the internal laptop speakers.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed however, that I was still able to use my headphones to receive sound while in Ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>From here on, I could boot into Windows 8.1 to receive sound through the internal speakers, but I could no longer get the sound to work again in Ubuntu 14.04 unless using headphones.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to experiment, so I completely wiped the disk, and did a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04. The sound was back! I then again proceeded to copy over my windows partition. Again, after booting into Windows 8.1, and then coming back to Ubuntu, my internal speakers would no longer produce sound.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried the most common solutions like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base pulseaudio\nsudo apt-get install alsa-base pulseaudio unity-control-center\nsudo alsa force-reload\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>pulseaudio -k\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also tried making sure that nothing was muted in alsamixer. I have also tried installing the pulse audio volume control tool. If I have a song playing, I can see the audio levels moving for the internal speakers, as if it should be playing.</p>\n\n<p>The pulse audio volume control tool also shows my HDMI card was a sound device, but it recognizes it as off.</p>\n\n<p>It may be worth noting that in alsamixer, the application seems to recognize my PCH/output card as the secondary card, and the HDMI as the first. However, this has always been the case, so I am not sure that is the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know a lot about how this is all engineered, but in my understanding I am having a hard time gathering how booting into another OS could stop the speakers from working in another.</p>\n\n<p>What can I do to restore sound to my system, and determine why booting into windows causes this behaviour? I would very much like to use a dual boot system.</p>\n\n<p>lspci -v output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT DRAM Controller (rev 09)\n    Subsystem: Dell Device 05f9\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0\n    Capabilities: &lt;access denied&gt;\n\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n    Subsystem: Dell Device 05fa\n    Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 60\n    Memory at e3000000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4M]\n    Memory at c0000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]\n    I/O ports at 5000 [size=64]\n    Expansion ROM at &lt;unassigned&gt;

But it only activates 3 channels in my audio system. Front Left, Right and the Sub woofer. Other channels don't work well. Here is the ALSA Mixer in terminal, I can\"t volume up those channel from there.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/a2jTf.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"> </p>\n\n<p>Please give me simple and clear solution for to get this right.

If I had to describe it, it's sort of as if the music had been mixed with the sound that played when connecting to a dial-up connection back in the day - just random, data-sounding clicks and pops, interspersed with sudden (fraction-of-a-second-long) mutes. When this happens, some volume levels will mute the sound entirely and become a series of high-pitched crackles; switching volume back will restore the (still-corrupted) sound.</p>\n\n<p>This happens in both Rhythmbox and Audacious, as well as with Flash e.g. when watching YouTube videos. The problem is very sporadic - sometimes it won't happen for a week, sometimes it will happen twice within the same day. The only link is changing the system volume, but there's no other common element (no particular volume threshold that always triggers it, say). One thing I have noticed is that it happens often if I change the fade slider between front and rear speakers (The laptop has a subwoofer, which for some reason is seen by Ubuntu as the front speaker - so I generally have to pan it slightly towards the rear so as not to have an overabundance of bass - the corruption when changing volume, though, happens when I am using headphones as well as when using the built-in speakers)</p>\n\n<p>Closing all applications (or Firefox tabs, in the case of Flash) that are using the sound card in some way and re-opening them fixes the problem.</p>\n\n<p>This could possibly be linked to the HDMI port on the laptop (I don't use it but have heard things about its less-than-great interactions between this model and Ubuntu's sound drivers), or perhaps to the issue where I have to open <code>alsamixer</code> and change the <code>Speaker</code> volume to get my headphones to work whenever they are plugged in; but beyond that I can't think of any specific cause or solution for this.</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if there are any debug outputs that would help figuring out the cause of this issue (I don't know for certain what diagnostics I can run for this)</p>\n\n<p>So far I've identified this happening in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rhythmbox</li>\n<li>Audacious</li>\n<li>Firefox (w/Flash player)</li>\n<li>VidyoDesktop (conference calling software)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'd be hesitant to say that this is affecting <em>all</em> sound applications, but that could well be the case - it happens so intermittently that it's difficult to test in specific programs.</p>\n\n<p>Update: Even stranger, over the last couple of days it has ceased to be simply a \"when changing volume\" issue, and sometimes happens simply when changing tracks (though changing the volume exacerbates it once it's started). I'm starting to wonder whether it could be some strange interaction between the MP3 codecs and the sound drivers [I have a dualboot system with music in MP3 format stored on my Windows drive] - though that wouldn't go any way to explaining why it also happens with Flash, so I am utterly stumped.</p>\n"},{"id":309975,"title":"No audio/sound in Ubuntu 13.04","body":"<p>Issue: No sound comes from built-in speakers and headphone jacks after doing a clean install of Ubuntu 13.04</p>\n\n<p>Setup: Dual-boot with Windows Vista Home Basic (used mainly for Adobe CS)\nAudio: Intel HDA\nChip: Conexant CX20561 (Hermosa)</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I get when I run [CODE]aplay -l[/CODE] in Terminal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 0: CONEXANT Analog [CONEXANT Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 0: Intel [HDA Intel], device 1: Conexant Digital [Conexant Digital]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've already updated the alsa and pulseaudio drivers after the clean install, still no sound.</p>\n\n<p>Caveat: No sound as well when logged into Windows Vista partition even if sound card/device is listed as installed and working properly in Device Manager.
