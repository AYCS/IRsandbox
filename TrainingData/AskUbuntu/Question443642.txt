The same clickpad seems to be used in the T440 and W540 models as well. I would like to turn off the touchpad but still be able to use the trackpoint. However, the new clickpad notebooks do not have physical mouse buttons. Instead regions on the touchpad must be mapped to the mouse buttons left, middle, right. I.e. simply turning off the touchpad in the ubuntu/unity settings would disable the mouse buttons as well.
