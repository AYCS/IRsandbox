After playing several videos, all system sound stops completely even though the video player and Sound Settings are NOT muted.   Adjusting the system volume does NOT bring the sound back.  But if I plug in headphones, the sound through the headphones is perfect.  Also, putting the laptop into sleep mode and then waking it up makes the speakers start working again, ... until I play a couple more videos.  Then the whole problem repeats.</p></li>\n<li><p>It doesn't matter WHICH videos are played; it has happened with a dozen different videos in different formats: MP4, FLV, AVI, WMV, etc...   Some videos will play fine; then later the sound will go out if I replay the same video.  The sound outage seems to happen at random.  I'm unable to see any connection between the number, size, or format of the videos; i.e. no specific vid or vids are more likely to cause the sound loss.  That said, the majority of my vids are MP4.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sometimes this issue happens while a video is playing; other times a video will finish with sound on but the next video will start with no sound.   I can't identify any specific trigger that happens immediately before the sound cuts out.</p></li>\n<li><p>This issue started occurring a week or 2 ago; prior to that I had no sound issues with Ubuntu.  That plus the fact that the headphones still work made me want to test whether this is just a hardware problem with the speakers themselves.   The system is dual-boot and, if I boot into Windows 7, I can play unlimited videos through the speakers with no sound loss.  Which points me back to the Ubuntu software as the culprit.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another symptom that might or might not be related.  For the last week or 2, whenever I doubleclick on a video it can take anywhere from 10-to-20 seconds for the video to start playing.  In the past, the vids would start playing within a couple seconds.

No effect.</p></li>\n<li><p>I restored the entire / partition using a backup I made the day I installed Ubuntu 14.10, then used Software Updater to bring the patches up-to-date.  This also did not change the symptoms in any way.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Can anyone recommend some troubleshooting steps?</p>\n\n<p>... Or a way to reset Ubuntu's sound without having to put it into sleep mode every time this issue happens?</p>\n\n<p>Or something I can uninstall so the issue doesn't occur?
