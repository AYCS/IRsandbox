There is question about this matter but it is closed for being too specific . I think this is a general issue about Sony Vaio laptops with nVidia graphics. I had this problem when I used 10.04 and it still exists on 12.04. Since this is too annoying I just duplicate that <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/184746/brightness-going-up-to-100-on-loading-certain-websites-in-chrome\">question</a> by <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/users/87917/picheto\">picheto</a>:</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm using Google Chrome version 21.0.1180.89 on Ubuntu 12.04 and my laptop is a Sony VAIO VPCCW15FL (spec sheet). My video driver is the propietary \"NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (post-release updates)(version-current updates)\".</p>\n\n<p>After installing Ubuntu, I discovered that neither the brightness control buttons (hardware) or the brightness slider (software) worked, and found out I could get the hardware buttons to work by installing the nvidiabl.deb package and oBacklight script. I'm using nvidiabl-dkms 0.77 and oBacklight 0.3.8. Still, the slider on the Ubuntu \"Settings\" does not work, but I don't care.</p>\n\n<p>There is an annoying thing happening when loading certain pages in Google Chrome: the brightness goes up to 100% when loading the webpage or when leaving it (closing the tab or typing a different URL on the omnibox). However, the \"brightness tooltip\" (that default brightness notification) remembers the position it was set to, so if I adjust the brightness with the HW buttons, the level gets adjusted relative to the value it was set to before \"going 100%\".</p>\n\n<p>I disabled the flash PPAPI plugin, but left the NPAPI plugin enabled, and the problem went away for pages with flash content. Still, the same thing happens when viewing HTML5 video, or when loading, for example, the Chrome Web Store or using the Scratchpad extension. I suppose it has to do with the rendering of certain elements using the GPU, but this is just a guess.</p>\n\n<p>This brightness thing does not happen when using Firefox 15.0 or any other application I have used yet.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody know why this may be happening and what could I do to fix this without changing browser? Thanks a lot.\"</p>\n"},{"id":351880,"title":"Unable to change brightness on Sony EH18FA","body":"<p>I couldn't change brightness of my Sony EH18FA laptop with Ubuntu 13.04.

As a normal user (without sudo), I can run  <code>xbacklight -40</code>, for example, and the backlight dims. It works great.</p>\n\n<p>I then opened the Keyboard settings, and tried to set up two custom shortcuts for controlling the backlight brightness. I named one as \"Brightness up\", with <code>xbacklight +10</code> as its command. Then I clicked to set the key, and \"Monitor brightness up\" showed up (as the key), so it was detected. However, even after rebooting, it didn't work. I tried changing the command to <code>/usr/bin/xbacklight +10</code> but it didn't work either.</p>\n\n<p>What's wrong with this? Also, I would like to know if I can make the brightness meter use the xbacklight command instead of its default. Is there any file I can change to do this? I think that would be even better than defining the shortcuts since it would integrate with the brightness bar.
