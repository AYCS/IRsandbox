If this can be fixed, please help me!</p>\n"},{"id":671453,"title":"After suspend and restart computer constantly power cycles","body":"<p>So this likely could just be hardware issue, but let me explain what happened first. </p>\n\n<p>So I have a pre-built desktop that I've been running Ubuntu/Windows for about 3-4 years now. It typically runs beautifully without any issues. However last year, for some reason USB ports would randomly die and then stop working. Then one time last year I left Ubuntu running over night(can't remember if suspended or not). I tried to get back on and it was locked up, couldn't do anything, so I just held the power button and restarted. </p>\n\n<p>It ran fine for another day or two, but then I left it running overnight again, again it was locked up, so I did a hard restart. But after that it started power cycling continously and it wouldn't reach bios screen or anything. I did some research and just decided to buy a new PSU and that seemed to fix the issue. I though eh, maybe it was just a crappy PSU, got a decent 650w (the original one was 450w or 500w I believe).</p>\n\n<p>So it ran great for another year, no issues. Ever since I usually just turned off my computer if I wasn't using it again that day, but yesterday I suspended it and forgot. So this morning I went to turn it on, and it was locked up again. Great. </p>\n\n<p>So I did a hard restart....and it started continously power cycling again. I did the same trouble shooting as before, unplugged, drained all power out, tried restarting, no luck. </p>\n\n<p>I never had any issues when I suspended/hibernated Windows. Could this be a Linux/Ubuntu issue? Or do I just possibly have weird hardware(prebuilt ibuypower desktop) or terrible luck with PSUs? </p>\n\n<p>I don't have conclusive evidence, but the behavior I have is exactly the same as when my PSU died last year.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: So I left my desktop unplugged and just now tried turning it on and it worked. I'm going to leave this question open though. If anyone has an idea why my computer might power cycle after being suspended I'd love to know.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if all the power wasn't drained out of the motherboard and there was something in there that might have made it power cycle. IDK, I don't know a whole lot about how the boot process works, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If I learn anything else I'll also post. </p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: So after about 30 minutes of use in ubuntu it froze up on me, then shut down and started trying to turn back on, then shutting off again. I wasn't doing anything particularly straining, just poking around with firefox and libreoffice open. If I'm able to get it, I'll boot into Windows and see if I have the same issue or not.   </p>\n"},{"id":636907,"title":"Ubuntu doesn&#39;t suspend or shutdown","body":"<p>I'm new in ubuntu world....</p>\n\n<p>My “Ubuntu” is not shutting down properly.
