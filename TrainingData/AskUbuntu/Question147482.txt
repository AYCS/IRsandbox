Yesterday I installed League of Legends via PlayOnLinux. I am not saying \"tried to install\", because it installed and patched perfectly fine, and the client works, too. </p>\n\n<p>I can log in, send messages, click on \"Play\", create a custom game (haven't tried any other type of game, for obvious reasons), pick a champion. And that's it. \nAt the point where the game should start, where the client disappears and the loading screen would usually pop up, nothing happens. The client minimizes and then the Wine logo peaks out of the hidden launcher again shortly after that, as if it was going to open up a new window, but it doesn't. </p>\n\n<p>Wine still shows the client as running, but I can't open it and when I open the task manager in POL \"Wine\" configuration it says it is not responding.</p>\n\n<p>I tried changing PlayOnLinux/Wine settings in several ways. When I ticked \"emulate virtual desktop\" in Wine configuration, everything went the same except that I was now stuck in a not responding full screen virtual windows desktop. I have the Windows version set to XP, but I also tried Windows 8. I installed Internet Explorer 8, I even un- and reinstalled PlayOnLinux as well as LoL yesterday. I patched with loltux. Nothing changes.</p>\n\n<p>It might be relevant that I am using AMD graphics with fglrx driver. I can give more information and debug if needed.</p>\n\n<p>I have no idea what to do. I have searched all related forums, but just installing POL and LoL seems to work for everyone else and those who have problems apparently don't have the same one as me.</p>\n\n<p>I might just be missing something important, I'm new to Ubuntu and haven't used Linux that much before.
