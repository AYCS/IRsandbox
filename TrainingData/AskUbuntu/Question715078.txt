I would like to remark that I was not using uppercase letters (which seems to be the reason why some other users could not create a new account on the questions I checked).</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I tried to create an account in GUI mode. After entering the new username on the account creation dialog I get this message:</p>\n\n<pre><code>running '/usr/sbin/adduser' failed: Child process exited with code 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After some googling I downloaded gnome-system-tools from the Ubuntu Software Centre. I enter all the data on the \"Create New User\" dialog and this is what I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>The configuration could not be saved\nInvalid data was found.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's when I decide to open the terminal and see what was going on. I enter the command <code>sudo adduser newuser</code> I get this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>adduser: The group `newuser' already exists.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>so I delete the group using the command <code>sudo delgroup newuser</code>, and use the previous command again. After doing so, I get this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Adding new group 'newuser' (1001) ...\nAdding new user 'newuser' (1001) with group 'newuser' ...\nuseradd: existing lock file /etc/subgid.lock without a PID\nuseradd: cannot lock /etc/subgid; try again later.\nadduser: '/usr/sbin/useradd -d /home/newuser -g newuser -s /bin/bash -u 1001 newuser' returned error code 18. Exiting.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, the newuser group is created, but not the user. However, when using the <code>useradd</code> command instead of <code>adduser</code>, I just get the two <code>useradd</code> lines above and no group is created. In neither case I'm able to create a new user. I also tried all these commands opening the terminal as root and it was useless. What should I do now?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I rebooted the machine twice, and repeated the process using the terminal as root.

Windows settings allow boot to display only monitor. Ubuntu boots to both displays. Super+P changes to lower resolution on both displays. Second Super+P changes to full resolution on attached monitor only as desired. How would I learn where to change a setting in Ubuntu so it displays full resolution on only the external monitor on boot up. External USB keyboard and Mouse also used.</p>\n\n<p>Ubuntu boots to login screen with display on both ASUS integral display and attached monitor. Lower resolution ASUS display is highlighted on monitor but USB attached mouse cursor will travel over full resolution of VGA attached monitor - shows on both monitors. After login, both displays are separately active and Apps launched from taskbar show up only on same display. Fast cursor motion into right side of ASUS display or left side of monitor crosses over into other display. This is really cool but I just want the higher resolution of the monitor. </p>\n\n<p>I tried Super+P because that is the key Windows 8.1 uses to set up display to only the monitor directly when booted. The first Super+P switches to Lower resolution on monitor and only part of the ASUS display in use but the same image is now on both displays. Great if that is what you want. A second Super+P blanks the ASUS display and, after the mouse is moved, returns the monitor to it's natural resolution. Exactly what I want.</p>\n\n<p>Because I turn off my computer when not actively using it to save power and reduce the potential for it's being hyjacked, I frequently reboot into Ubuntu. Consequently it would be nice it there is a setting somewhere that I could set like there is in Win 8.1 so the default behavior is what Ubuntu now requires two Super+Ps to get. </p>\n\n<p>I recognize my mode of operation is far from mainstream but impressed with how close it is to everything I want. Super+P is not documented in Keyboard shortcuts - just a lucky guess. So perhaps the setting I desire is also implemented but not documented - at least not where I know to look.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>asked Jan 4 at 1:02 on Stack Overflow\nHi! Welcome to the site.
