Windows was still working, of course.</p>\n\n<p>No big deal, I got back home and I prepared to install Ubuntu again.\nBut this time, I made a mistake myself. During the process, the system detected the previous installation of Ubuntu, so this time I didn't use the manual partitioning, but I selected the option to reinstall the OS.\nI thought it would only reinstall Ubuntu, leaving the Windows partition alone, but instead it formatted everything and installed Ubuntu as the only OS. </p>\n\n<p>After barely restrainin myself from throwing the PC out of the window, I created an empty partition and installed Windows in it.</p>\n\n<p>After the installation, the system booted Windows by default (no GRUB screen), which I guess is normal.....I loaded Ubuntu from the BIOS, and I used Boot Repair to solve it.\nIt gave me <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/KJ7KWmc.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">this error</a></p>\n\n<p>so I selected the Advanced Options, I activated the option \"Separate /boot/efi partition\" selecting the sda1 partition, and I launched it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I turn on the PC the GRUB screen appears, showing the options to load Ubuntu or WIndows.\nWhen I choose Ubuntu it works fine, but if I select Windows an error flashes for an instant, saying</p>\n\n<pre><code>Failed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\grubx64.efi - 800000000000000E\nFailed to load image\nFailed to open \\EFI\\Microsoft\\MckManager.efi - 00000000000000000E\nFailed to load image\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and it goes back to the GRUB screen.</p>\n\n<p>I created a Boot Repair log if it can be of any help:  <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/10290244\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/10290244</a></p>\n\n<p>Any ideas to solve this and load Windows again?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>P.S.
