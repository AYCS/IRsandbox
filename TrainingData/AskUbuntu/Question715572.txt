Im a new Ubuntu user and still on learning curve. After 8 years of OSX it is been harder than I expected. Two weeks ago I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on Samsung ATIV Book 9 Lite. I had hard time with BIOS and get machine boot from USB and finally boot to Ubuntu. Thats why I found this website and found fix to it.</p>\n\n<p>I think my machine is pretty much ready to go. I have followed lots of videos and articles such as \"top 5/10 things to do after installing Ubuntu\". So I have done all updates and tweaks through command line.</p>\n\n<p>I have premium plus account for CyberGhost VPN service so I wanted to install OpenVPN to my new fresh Linux machine. I found these excellent tutorial <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-qLZmp5WBo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-qLZmp5WBo</a></p>\n\n<p>sudo apt-get install openvpn\nsudo apt-get install openvpn bridge-utils\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome\nsudo restart network-manager</p>\n\n<p>for my big suprice my VPN was working after first attemp ! Big thank you again to Scott Hunt. VPN was working flawlessly but after reboot clicking task bar network -- VPN connections -- (name of my VPN) nothing happened. Wirelesss indicator was not even trying to connect.I tried another reboot and checked setting but all was as they should be. Its not connecting. I dont know how to check any error logs etc. even if do, it wont help me much...</p>\n\n<p>I though something went wrong during installation so I thought I could do fresh install of OS and update everything just to practice and get more comfortable with Ubuntu. When everything was back to square one I started install VPN again.</p>\n\n<p>This time following previous link from youtube and cyberghost own install guide <a href=\"https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/395/0/configure-openvpn-for-linux-mint\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://support.cyberghostvpn.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/395/0/configure-openvpn-for-linux-mint</a></p>\n\n<p>Like said my first attemp was using OpenVPN UDP .ovpn with you youtube provide settings and it worked fine until reboot.</p>\n\n<p>After fresh OS installation i made VPN with TCP .ovnp and provide setting from cyberghost link. And for my bit suprice new TCP vpn connection work after clicking it !! All was fine like after first vpn installation but... after reboot it wont connect again. After two weeks with Ubuntu experience I have no tools to troubleshoot this. Hours of searching answers from forums im more confused. I have no other option to post my question and hope someone would find time to write step by step instruction get this thing work and hopefully someone who has same problem founds it too.</p>\n\n<p>ok, i dont know what im doing here but i was able to find a command how to look log files. I dont know if these are any usefull because i dont understand or can read it. Maybe this is some help for someone ?</p>\n\n<p>cyberghost@CyberGhost:~$ grep VPN /var/log/syslog\nFeb 11 01:57:16 CyberGhost NetworkManager[737]:  Starting VPN service 'openvpn'...\nFeb 11 01:57:16 CyberGhost NetworkManager[737]:  VPN service 'openvpn' started (org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.openvpn), PID 3791\nFeb 11 01:57:16 CyberGhost NetworkManager[737]:  VPN service 'openvpn' appeared;

I could connect to the VPN network and open websites. </p>\n\n<p>I only coincidentally noticed though, that although the network manager tells me that I have successfully connected to the VPN network, my IP address does not change.</p>\n\n<p>I then looked into the Private Internet Access configuration files downloaded from the link above and found the port number 1194, which I opened using the firewall configuration tool Firewall.</p>\n\n<p>I also unticked the box 'Use this connection only for resources on its network' and connected to the VPN network. I can do Google searches and access one or two random websites, but then I get a 'connection failed' from the browser. </p>\n\n<p>It seems to connect to the VPN network successfully though. The IP address changes according to the host I am using.</p>\n\n<p>I would be really great full for some tips.
