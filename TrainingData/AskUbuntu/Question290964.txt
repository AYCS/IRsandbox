The short story here is that ttf-mscorefonts-install is broken and is completely constipating the process of trying to install or uninstall anything else. I have been trying various things listed in various forums to uninstall the database, clean the database, reinstall, uninstall and then reinstall, etc.  None of these work. What I always come back to is a dpkg error that looks like this:</p>\n\n<p>dpkg: error processing package ttf-mscorefonts-installer (--configure):\n package ttf-mscorefonts-installer is not ready for configuration\n cannot configure (current status 'half-installed')</p>\n\n<p>After trying the various apt-get clean, update, and remove options I finally get the message that:</p>\n\n<p>Testo@Testbox01:~$ apt-get remove ttf-mscorefonts-install\nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?</p>\n\n<p>So now the database is locked up and I'll have to reboot - again - to unlock it.</p>\n\n<p>So here is my question - how can I manually rip out ttf-mscorefonts-install and its dependencies by the roots so that they no longer infect the rest of the installed products database? What are the files that should be removed and where are they?
