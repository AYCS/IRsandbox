[{"id":715571,"title":"incorrect ownership problem","body":"<p>I used <code>sudo gedit</code> before I learned that I am supposed to use <code>gksudo gedit</code>. The side effect of this error is that some files change ownership. There seem to be 3 candidates in this screenshot that may exhibit the problem. Is there something wrong with the ownership listed here or do I need to wipe out Ubuntu, reformat, and reinstall? Is it possible to repair the ownership situation and if so, which files now have incorrect ownership? How deep does the ownership problem go? All directory levels? Is the screenshot of the <code>~</code> directory sufficient to diagnose what happened or do more directory levels need to be examined and corrected? A reformat would be inconvenient so I'm hoping there is a programmatic fix.\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sh18b.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/sh18b.png\" alt=\"screenshot of ~ directory\"></a></p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":641469,"title":"An Odd Gedit Font Problem","body":"<p>For some reason I can not change my font type or colour in <code>Gedit</code>. </p>\n\n<p>I tried going into <code>preference</code>, and choosing a <code>colour scheme</code> (the background changed only). </p>\n\n<p>I was unable to even change the font type or size, I was able to choose one (I chose liberation Mono Regular 12) but it did not change the font it kept the default. </p>\n\n<p>Nothing seems to be working.</p>\n"},{"id":574166,"title":"Problem while creating the 95proxies file","body":"<p>When I run this command in Terminal:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The following message is displayed:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d is directory\nplease check that you typed the location correctly and try again\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please help in resolving this to create 95 proxies file in <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d</code> path.</p>\n"},{"id":417961,"title":"Problem opening Gedit Ubuntu 13.10","body":"<p>I have this problem while trying to open Gedit in Ubuntu 13.10: </p>\n\n<pre><code>gedit: symbol lookup error: gedit: undefined symbol: g_option_context_parse_strv\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I reinstalled Ubuntu, and afterwards I got this issue.
