After installing Ubuntu, the boot screen is not shown full screen. It's shown in sort of a black frame like the resolution isn't high enough. When I change it to my native monitor resolution 1920x1080 the letters and logo assume the new resolution but the logo still isn't full screen. When I check the resolutions available for GRUB2 with vbeinfo command my resolution isn't listed. But I noticed, when I boot up from the Ubuntu Installation USB the boot logo is shown in full 1920x1080 resolution, no black bars and all. It's not a serious problem but it really annoys me. Can anyone help or suggest why this is happening.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.
