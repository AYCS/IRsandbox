And I have ubuntu installed alongside the windows 8.1. \nBut I can't use Touchscreen as I can in Windows 8.1 in my Ubuntu 14.04.\nI want to use it. So my question is that  <strong>how to enable touch screen in ubuntu 14.04?</strong></p>\n"},{"id":613560,"title":"Ubuntu 15.04 on HP Pavilion x2 - 13-r100dx Laptop","body":"<p>I purchased this laptop at the beginning of 2015 and I have loved the little guy. It does wonders as a laptop, is a bit clunky as a tablet but quite fun to have both options available at hand. I recently decided I was fed up with the battery life and usability of Windows 8.1 I had to constantly use razer's cortex to get any ounce of power from it and it became cumbersome to constantly be disabling features and breaking many of my apps in the process. I swapped back to my beloved Linux OS on the device about 2 weeks ago. Everything is going smooth when I use it as a laptop, but when I un-dock it from the base I come across a problem that it feels awkward to use the OS. I will explain what I am see.</p>\n\n<p>Currently the touch screen does work, but a little weird and not at all what I want it to be (Mind you I am not even sure Ubuntu 15.04 runs a great touch screen support but I really want it on this laptop seeing that I am pulling 6+ hours of battery life verses the 4 I was getting on Windows). I can use it to scroll on web pages and such but it mostly works like a right click and doesn't count as a left click. I was wondering if someone had a way to make it if I long press it would act as a right click but the rest of the time work as a left click? There has to be a way to do it but currently I haven't found anything to get that working. I have onboard as a hotkey on my top bar that is docked to the bass and looks quite sexy honestly but the touch interface makes tablet use rather difficult so I have yet to really use it undocked.</p>\n\n<p>Second, my trackpad is rather strange. I can use it and it functions just fine IE two finger scrolling, two finger tap for right click, one finger tap for left click, full left click support when I press down and it clicks but it doesn't use a right click if I press down on the right hand side of the track-pad ever. See my dilemma? I have gorilla arm going on when I need to right click most of the time because I forget about the double finger tap to right click, but to get a good experience with left clicking I have to keep it docked. Not hard to bypass when I am at a desk and hook a mouse into the USB on the back. Aside from that everything is going swimmingly with the laptop. All my special keys and function keys are working, 15.04 is a breath of fresh life to the crap software that was installed from the get go.</p>\n\n<p>Third, I have the 4G model of the device and I tried to set the APN from my carrier into the OS. When I am hooked up on WiFi I can see the name of the carrier but it isn't pulling any kind of LTE signal from my carrier (Which is a small Idaho based carrier that 99.9% of the world doesn't know but I work for them so I have a bit of the inner workings on things like our APN and other things if needed to get it working) if anyone has a hint to point me in the right direction that would be great. The frequency is 700 MHZ and the SIM I inserted matches the band class that is in there, but it came with Verizon as its standard so I am not sure there is a way around that little feature, but that is life and it isn't a big deal if we don't get the 4G working.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth on my list. There is a micro SD card slot on the tablet itself. I have a UHS-10 64 gig card inserted. Windows could read it, Ubuntu currently isn't. I am certain there is a way to get that working but I am still pretty newbish to the Linux community that I honestly figured getting assistance instead of borking my install would be best.</p>\n\n<p>Last on my list. I have Beats audio. I want that good booming bass that comes with it. Are there drivers or a setting I can kick on to give it that extra umph?\nIf you have any hints or ideas about any of these let me know, or if you have a better place I can request pointing me in the right direction would be fantastic as well.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a link for reference so you can see what it looks like and such, I haven't seen anyone else online posting about this specific model but many ask about the Split X2 13 inch model. I believe it is the same type just minus the 4G LTE (I got the Pavilion upgrade from the Split X2 13 free because the site was sold out so they honored the price of the Split for the Pav X2 talk about lucky)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://store.hp.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/us/en/pdp/Laptops/hp-pavilion-x2---13-r100dx-laptop-p-g6q91ua-aba\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://store.hp.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/us/en/pdp/Laptops/hp-pavilion-x2---13-r100dx-laptop-p-g6q91ua-aba</a></p>\n\n<p>I really appreciate any help once again and I am glad to be a part of this splendid community.</p>\n"},{"id":590524,"title":"touch screen not working for HP Compaq 2710p !!!NEED HELP!","body":"<p>I have a huge problem when I installed Ubuntu to my HP Compaq 2710p I lost my touch screen capabilities its touch through pen only.

I'll update this within 24 hours with more details, or as soon as they are available. Whichever comes first.</p>\n\n<p>I am enrolled in an engineering class that requires a year-end presentation. My presentation is a couple weeks out, and I've just hit a roadblock. My previous plan was to haul in and hook up my desktop, but school policy changed and I'm not allowed to do that any more. Instead, my dad has allowed me to use an old laptop for my presentation.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is where the problems begin. His laptop is an XP machine. The software I need for my presentation is PowerPoint (or Libreoffice Impress), Logger Pro (I have the .deb packages), and a couple more programs that I wrote, that will ONLY work on Linux.</p>\n\n<p>My dad has a Dell Vostro 1500, which was released in 2007. Specs are <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/products/dell-vostro-1500-laptop-computer-intel-celeron-m-m540-1-86ghz-ddr2-sdram-1-00mb-80-gb/specs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>He is offering me the laptop he used for a couple years before that, so something probably released in the 2004-2005 range. I don't have specs right now (or even know what laptop it will be, just that it was an XP box and could run CAD software).</p>\n\n<p>I am looking for a distro that has/can/is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run LibreOffice</li>\n<li>Install Debian Packages</li>\n<li>Run Scripts that can listen to hardware</li>\n<li>Minimal system footprint</li>\n<li>Preferably Debian or Ubuntu based, as I have experience with these distros</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the older laptop works, what would be a good candidate for a distro that can do the above, while using minimal memory?</p>\n\n<p>If the older laptop does not work, what distro could do the above on a Dell Vostro 1500 (<a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/products/dell-vostro-1500-laptop-computer-intel-celeron-m-m540-1-86ghz-ddr2-sdram-1-00mb-80-gb/specs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">specs, again</a>) quickly and efficiently?</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of options such as Puppy Linux and Tiny Core Linux, but those are not good options. While they run fast, my scripts need something based off of Ubuntu or Debian to run and display correctly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The older laptop cannot be found, so I am using the Dell Vostro 1500. I have been allowed to partition the HDD, and added a 30Gb (the other partition has 10Gb free space left) partition. I installed Xubuntu (I have 2Gb of ram, and decided to capatilize on it), Logger Pro, Libreoffice, and other software I need. In fact, I am editing this from the laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Some slight issues were had with the trackpad (now THAT was fun to fix, without access to a mouse) and WiFi, but those were issues commonly had and easily fixed.</p>\n"},{"id":328752,"title":"Do Dell Laptop Touch Screen Monitors Work with Ubuntu 12.04/12.10?","body":"<p>I'm about to buy a Dell Precision m6700 that I plan on dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 (or 12.10, feel free to comment) and I'm wondering if I should get the touch screen monitor designed for Windows 8.
