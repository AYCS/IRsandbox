I was using dd to copy a disk image onto an SD card for a Raspberry PI, but managed to copy the image onto /dev/sda instead of /dev/sdc.  Problem now is, of course, that I've nuked the entire MBR and directory structure of the hard drive. I've reconfigured with a new drive, and this time I've dual booted the thing and taken a copy of the MBR so that if the same thing happens again, it will only clobber windows.  </p>\n\n<p>What I want to know is, is there any way at all to recover the file system once the first few GB of the hard drive have been overwtitten?

I basically use it to keep all my movies and videos. Its file system is NTFS, and currently I'm using 1.4TB. One night I turn it on and copied a 4GB file and there was no problem. Then I tried to copy another 6GB file and Ubuntu throw the following error: <em>\"Input/output error\"</em>. I tried to create a new folder with no luck. I still could read the disk an play a file, so I thought restarting the computer would solve the problem, but it didn't. The next time, Ubuntu didn't mount the disk. </p>\n\n<p>After that I tried in another PC with Window 7. It throwed a message telling me: first, that the disk needs to be formatted, and second, a <em>\"Local Disk #: Is not accessible. Data error (cyclic redundancy check)\"</em>. Here is when I started to worry. I tried to fix the disk with CHKDSK (chkdsk \\r). After about 5 hours, it crashed with the following error: <em>\"An unspecified error occurred\"</em>.</p>\n\n<p>My guess to all this is that the disk is dying. :'(</p>\n\n<p>Lastly I did one more thing.

My guess is that sectors on the disk are dying. Am I right?</p>\n\n<p>If every time I turn on the disk more sectors are going to die, I need to copy the data fast. I don't know if there is a solution on Windows, and I'm worried about the time that it could take to do it with the slowness of Windows. Basically my question is: How can I recover the data? (Or at least some of it). Is there any program on Ubuntu that can help me with this (If I'm still on time)?. My main concern is the size of the disk (2TB), so I think I would need at least another 2TB disk to copy to.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>\n"}]}]
