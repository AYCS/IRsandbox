However, the tutorials/responses that I have looked at mention partitioning the hard drive with certain specifications using GParted, which I don't know how to use or even how to open. I am running a Windows 10 Home system, and I would like to install Ubuntu alongside it (for various reasons). I already have the Windows 10 installation media and Ubuntu 15 installation media (on a USB drive). Where do I go from here? I would like to have both systems installed on my 250 GB SSD, so that I can use my 1 TB HDD for storage. I have 8 GB of 1066 DDR3 RAM as well.

I now have a 32GB partition set aside for the secondary OS (being Ubuntu), but I'm unable to boot to it; the computer simply proceeds to boot to Windows 10 instead.</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost, I should note that when I power up my PC, I'm not presented with the GRUB boot menu that would show up on a BIOS motherboard (since I have UEFI, this comes as no surprise to me anyway).</p>\n\n<p>I've tried checking boot priority under the F2 UEFI settings menu, but Ubuntu did not appear in that list, only Windows Boot Manager and a few other drives.</p>\n\n<p>I've also tried setting my UEFI firmware settings to boot as legacy BIOS firmware, which failed miserably (it said there was no boot manager found) and forced me to reset the firmware settings (no big deal, Windows and the Ubuntu partition both were unaffected by this).</p>\n\n<p>I'm bringing this up here because I have only found successful demos of Windows 10-Ubuntu dual boots on either older computers that already have BIOS firmware or newer laptops of non-Acer brands.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way around this where I can safely boot to my Ubuntu partition on the HDD (not the USB stick) and not have to remove Windows? If so, can this method be reversible, should I decide I don't want Linux on my laptop anymore?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"id":697745,"title":"Dual booting Windows 10 and Ubuntu from two seperate drives","body":"<p>I have Windows 10 installed on my C: drive and I am looking to install Ubuntu 15 to dual boot alongside it.

However, I did some things on Ubuntu that caused some of the packages to become \"inconsistent\", and I tried to fix them but it didn't really work. Rather than try, probably in vain, to fix it, I thought I would just uninstall it, repartition everything and go through the whole installation again, and be more careful not to cause the same errors.</p>\n\n<p>But if I simply erase the partitions, I won't be able to boot Windows, and unfortunately I don't have any sort of recovery disk/drive, I searched for hours and I've come to the conclusion that I will have to have Microsoft mail me a recovery disk, it's simply not available online. I do have the recovery partition, however. But the problem is that Windows doesn't seem to be recognizing it as such. If I try to use the wizard to create a recovery drive it tells me there is no recovery partition and that it doesn't have all the required files. In MiniTool Partition Wizard, it is clearly labeled \"Recovery\", and I checked the contents and it has everything it is supposed to have. But Windows doesn't think it exists, at least not as a recovery partition. In the Windows disk manager it is labeled as \"Healthy (OEM Partition)\". Maybe that is what it is supposed to be, but regardless it doesn't let me create any recovery media.</p>\n\n<p>So how can I do this? I want to keep Windows just the way it is as far as my files and programs, but basically unpartition the drive and allow Windows to be the only operating system again, as if I never had Ubuntu on there in the first place. I may reinstall Ubuntu afterwards, or try doing it a different way, or try a different Linux OS altogether. But I can't do this unless I restore the partitions and the Windows boot configuration. </p>\n\n<p>I have an idea but I'm not sure it will work, so I wanted to get some opinions from people who have more experience. If I were to manually copy the recovery partition to an external drive, could I then make it bootable, boot into it without even touching the partitions myself, and use the recovery disk to do all the repartitioning and restoration of Windows configuration by itself, without losing my Windows files, programs and setup? That would be ideal, because if I got stuck not able to boot into Windows it would be a huge problem, especially if the Ubuntu partitions were totally gone. Then I wouldn't even be able to reinstall it and regain the Ubuntu boot configuration, unless I formatted my Windows partition. I don't want to do that.</p>\n"},{"id":311678,"title":"how to restore window partition in ubuntu dual booting?","body":"<p>my pc hard disk 500gb.my computer C,D,E,F,G ,H Partition .c  is window 8 partition.H installed Ubuntu  12.10 used dual booting.
