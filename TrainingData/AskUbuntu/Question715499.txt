I recently decided to install ubuntu on it as the sole OS as it was running 10.4.11 and was unable to meet my current needs.  The optical drive on it is broken,  so I downloaded the ubuntu iso,  converted it to a DMG and created a bootable flash drive.  Everything seemed to be going great.  I used gparted to wipe the hard drive and than began running the installer from the live enviro.   That's when things took a turn for the worst..  Half way through the installer crashed.  I attempted it a few more times,  but it eventually just froze solid.  I asked around what to do and was told to just reboot and try again.  Now it is not seeing the flash drive, and there is no OS to boot to,  so I'm just getting the ol' grey screen with a flashing question mark..  </p>\n\n<p>I bought a new 500gig external that I can format for a mac..
