This happens upon synchronisation with the google list of contacts (where they remain unchanged and uncopied).<br>\nI tried several things and went so far as to completely remove my contacts from both phone and google account, to start from fresh.\nI then reloaded my contacts in google and staarted the sync.  Result: <strong>all my contacts are on my phone 3 times</strong>.  I could not notice the slightiest difference between all copies.<br>\nI suspect this is because I entered 3 times my google account in the phone. \nThis is clearly a bug that i notified here: <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/address-book-app/+bug/1499663\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bug #1499663</a> </p>\n\n<p>Now my question: does anybody know how to suppres the google accounts to synchronize on the ubuntu phone?

The calendar finds the set up GOA without any problems and also syncs it with the calendar app integrated in Gnome Shell (appearing in the top panel). \nI can also add events that will show up in my Google Calendar online without any problems. But when I add a new event online into the Google Calendar and the GOA already set up it won't sync onto my Laptop, so the California Calendar does not get a update on my Calendar events. \nI also tried to set it up with Thunderbird and Evolution resulting with the dead end.</p>\n\n<p>Is bidirectional sync not possible, am I doing something wrong or is it a bug? </p>\n\n<p>I hope I got my point clear and to maybe find someone to help me. </p>\n\n<p>Cheers,\nMichi</p>\n"},{"id":484619,"title":"Google Contacts: Browse by Group, Sync","body":"<p>Running Ubuntu 14.04 with Gnome 3.12 with an added Google account through Online Accounts, I automatically get incorporated calendar, email and contacts.</p>\n\n<p>Alas, the Contacts application is close to useless for handling my Google contacts, as it shows <strong>all</strong> contacts.

With the introduction of paid syncing for phones, it doesn't seem like there is anyway to sync Thunderbird contacts with UbuntuOne without paying for a phone plan.
