Googling \"grub takes 30 seconds to load\" brought up a bunch of other threads, but their problem was slightly different. In their problems they said that the computer sat at \"grub loading\" for 30 seconds. However, mine doesn't even show \"grub loading\" until the end of the 30 seconds. I'm not sure if this is a problem with grub or a problem with my bios/new drive.
