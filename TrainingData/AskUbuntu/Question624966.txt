I've tried both with having the installer install the updates, as well as without updates. No matter what I do, it installs fine, but then freezes up as soon as I log in.</p>\n\n<p>I have done so much googling about this issue, but can't find anything that's helped me resolve it. I found a few posts talking about Nvidia driver issues, and about running <em>sudo apt-get install nvidia-current</em> and so on. I tried that before and it somehow just got even more broken and mangled, and wouldn't even boot up anymore, so I had to reinstall Ubuntu yet again. Now I can't even try that anymore. I did a fresh boot, and as usual it freezes up when I log in. But now I can't even access the terminal to try anything - pressing Ctrl+Fn+F2 at the login screen just takes me to a black screen with a \"_\" character drawn in the top-left corner, but I can't type anything.</p>\n\n<p>What am I supposed to do? How do I get this to work?</p>\n\n<p>I don't have a lot of experience with Linux, but it's always intrigued me and I was excited to play with Ubuntu, so this is really disappointing. This is the third time I have attempted to use Linux in my life (with different distros and computers), and it <em>never, ever, ever works</em>. It's so incredibly frustrating to just keep trying the same thing over and over and have it never work. I was really hoping that I could give this old laptop a \"new lease of life\" as they say, due to Linux running better on weaker hardware than Windows. I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me figure out how to fix this.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, and Merry Christmas.</p>\n"},{"id":696903,"title":"login loop even after remove nvidia driver","body":"<p>I've got infinite loop problem after installing CUDA (which automatically install nvidia driver).
