[{"id":714394,"title":"Hard drive dying - Reinstall Windows after Ubuntu","body":"<p>I realize that this is not a 100% Ubuntu question as Microsoft Windows is also part of the problem, but I hope that this is still the right address.</p>\n\n<p>I also want to mention that I read this similar question: <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/6317/how-can-i-install-windows-after-ive-installed-ubuntu\">How can I install Windows after I&#39;ve installed Ubuntu?</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The situation is as follows: I have a notebook with two hard drives. One 1TB HDD (/dev/sda) and one 120GB SSD (/dev/sdb). Windows 8 is installed on the HDD (sda) and Ubuntu 14.04 was installed afterwards on the SSD (sdb).</p>\n\n<p>Now my HDD is dying: gnome-disk-utility tells me that there are issues and a Seagate tool verifies this. Hence, I made a backup of my data from the HDD and I am about to buy a new 1 TB HDD to replace the old one.</p>\n\n<p>My plan is to replace the defective hard drive with the new one and install Windows 10 on it. I have got a Windows 10 key and a iso file from which I intend to create a bootable USB drive. </p>\n\n<p>My question is now, how the installation is done in detail. I always read that it is not recommended to install Windows after Ubuntu, because the MBR gets overwritten and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure, where grub is currently installed (from <code>gnome-disk-utility</code> I see that <code>/dev/sda2</code> (type EFI-System) is mounted in <code>/boot/efi</code>, does that mean that grub is installed on sda (=defective HDD)?). I also do not know what will happen if I remove the HDD. Will it still be possible to boot into Ubuntu?</p>\n\n<p>So my schedule would be as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Backup all data from <code>/dev/sda</code> (=old HDD)</li>\n<li>Create Ubuntu bootable USB flash drive</li>\n<li>Create Windows 10 bootable USB flash drive (different USB stick)</li>\n<li>Remove old HDD from notebook and plug in new one</li>\n<li>Check if I can still boot into Ubuntu (I guess no?)</li>\n<li>Boot from Windows 10 USB flash drive and install Windows 10 on new HDD</li>\n<li>Boot from Ubuntu USB stick and create Grub menu (this point needs clarification!)</li>\n<li>Done. Dualboot with Windows 10 on new hdd and Ubuntu on \"old\" SSD</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is this a reasonable plan? Where might there be problems? What about this whole (U)EFI business - do I have to keep something in mind here?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Remarks after the installation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Everything worked out without any problems. After removing the old HDD and plugging in the new one, I was not able to boot into Ubuntu again (just as expected). With the Live USB I booted Ubuntu and formatted the new HDD to NTFS. Then I booted with the Windows 10 USB drive and started the installation. However, Windows did not like the ntfs (or whatever) and so it refused to install. Deleting the partition and letting Windows do it stuff resolved this. After the installation of Windows 10, I booted again into Ubuntu with the Live USB, ran boot-repair with the recommended settings and now I got my parallel boot back. Everything works just fine!</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":675627,"title":"Add Windows 10 to GRUB","body":"<p>I got two ssds installed in my notebook, one in the HDD Slot and one in the upgrade bay/cd-drive slot.</p>\n\n<p>Thats the order how I have installed the OS:<br>\n1.

My PC has a 2TB hard drive where Windows 8 and all my data was installed. In order to make the Linux partition I used an external 500GB hard drive and left the 2TB one untouched, but the first time that I ran the Ubuntu installer I made the partitions (4 in total) in the external drive but had to quit due to an emergency at the time, so I reverted the partitions I had made, quit the installer and shut down the PC. \nWhen I turned it on again it automatically opened the GRUB where no Windows 8 option was available, as I ran the Ubuntu installer again it did not find any other OS installed which I found odd but still continued, once again I made the partitions in the external drive, leaving the PC 2TB hard drive untouched and finalized it. \nNow whenever I turn on the computer I can't access Windows 8 only Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I can still see the NTFS partitions are there because I used suds testdisk and I can see them exactly as they were before. \nMy question is how can I recover Windows 8, or access it, or at least recover my data? </p>\n"},{"id":659260,"title":"Where should I install the boot loader on a second drive?","body":"<p>So I recently installed a second hard drive in my laptop.

I manually created 3 ubuntu partitions all on the ssd (root, swap, and home).</p>\n\n<p>My question is, where do i install the boot loader? I do not want ubuntu and windows to boot separately, so i was thinking the bootloader should go onto my ssd. The installer defaulted to dev/sda which it says is my 1tb hdd, but I can change it to dev/sdb which it says is my ssd. I'm not exactly sure where windows is booting from, but putting the bootloader on my hdd doesn't really make sense to me. So should I put the bootloader on dev/sda or deb/sdb? </p>\n\n<p>Btw, my laptop is uefi. \nThank you.</p>\n"},{"id":560980,"title":"Already dual booting windows and ubuntu but want to install latest ubuntu on another hard drive","body":"<p>so currently I'm already dual booting windows and ubuntu.
