[{"id":710960,"title":"Video display problems Ubuntu on Asus UX305: Skype (and VLC and other programs)","body":"<p>I'd greatly appreciate any help with the following. I have problems with video display, occurring in VLC, SMPlayer and in Skype. For VLC and SMPlayer I have found a workaround, for Skype not.\nThe problem is that the video does not resize and it remains on top of other windows, even when I switch to other applications. The Skype image flickers.</p>\n\n<p>Details about the problem and how to produce it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clean install of Ubuntu 15.10 AMD64 on an Asus</li>\n<li>Install VLC and SMPlayer and Skype</li>\n<li>Open any video in VLC</li>\n<li>Resize the VLC window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What happens now is that the video itself does not resize. It remains the same size but is centered in the VLC window. The remaining space in the VLC window is filled with blue. This blue flickers blue/black while I resize the window.\nFurthermore, the video frame is on top of other windows, even when I switch to another application. It also overlaps with the pull-down menu of VLC itself, meaning that I cannot read most of the options in the menus because the video is on top of them.\nSurprisingly, when I go to VLC Tools, Preferences, Video, and select at Output \"OpenGL GLX video output (XCB)\" then the problem disappears and everything is normal. Same thing for \"X11 video output (XCB)\". The problem re-appears however when I choose \"VDPAU output\" or \"XVideo output (XCB)\" or, for that matter, \"Automatic\".</p>\n\n<p>So for VLC I have a workaround. But for Skype I do not. The Skype problem is similar:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open Skype, make a call, activate the web cam.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The video of the person receiving the call is fine until I open my own webcam. The image flickers continuously (blue). </p>\n\n<p>Background about my machine:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Asus UX305C.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Details from lspci:</p>\n\n<pre><code>floris@ava:~$ lspci\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation Sky Lake Host Bridge/DRAM Registers (rev 08)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Sky Lake Integrated Graphics (rev 07)\n00:04.0 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Device 1903 (rev 08)\n00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation Device 9d2f (rev 21)\n00:14.2 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Device 9d31 (rev 21)\n00:15.0 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Device 9d60 (rev 21)\n00:15.1 Signal processing controller: Intel Corporation Device 9d61 (rev 21)\n00:16.0 Communication controller: Intel Corporation Device 9d3a (rev 21)\n00:17.0 SATA controller: Intel Corporation Device 9d03 (rev 21)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Device 9d13 (rev f1)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation Device 9d46 (rev 21)\n00:1f.2 Memory controller: Intel Corporation Device 9d21 (rev 21)\n00:1f.3 Audio device: Intel Corporation Device 9d70 (rev 21)\n00:1f.4 SMBus: Intel Corporation Device 9d23 (rev 21)\n01:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 7265 (rev 59)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Kernel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>floris@ava:~$ uname -r\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ubuntu:</p>\n\n<pre><code>4.2.0-19-genericfloris@ava:~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 15.10\nRelease:        15.10\nCodename:       wily\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help or thoughts appreciated!</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":411990,"title":"VLC do not plays video files","body":"<p>VLC do not play any kind of video file.

","body":"<p>Recently VLC has been having issues displaying video in fullscreen mode. AFAIK, nothing has changed with the video card drivers and it's certainly the same version of VLC.  (/me shakes a fist at the repository maintainers)</p>\n\n<p>This has worked without issue in the past.  In fact, I've had as many as 6 instances of VLC running, each playing a video.  One was always fullscreen on my second monitor, while the others were tiled on my primary monitor.  I was able to toggle any of the other 5 into fullscreen mode and the video displayed without issue.</p>\n\n<p>Lately, I've been having trouble running 2 instances in fullscreen mode.  (Sometimes, even a single instance will not display the video in fullscreen.)  VLC will continue to play the video, but in fullscreen mode I see nothing but a black screen.  Sometimes, the video will display if I maximize the VLC window.  Other times, I have to settle for a smaller sized window.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if this is pertinent, but sometimes changing the min/max state of a Firefox window (Minefield, specifically) seemed to allow the troublesome instance to display the video in fullscreen mode.  However, that did not prove to be a consistent workaround.  Sometimes, it seemed that closing a Firefox window did the trick, though that isn't consistently successful either.  (I futzed with Firefox, because with the crazy number of windows and tabs that I normally have open, it regularly hogs about 1 GB of RAM.)</p>\n\n<p>Another bit of funkiness that comes to mind is the fact that my secondary monitor is considered the primary on boot-up.  I use xrandr to designate the real 1st monitor as primary after boot-up, as suggested by someone in a <a href=\"http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5263/is-it-possible-to-control-which-monitor-is-considered-the-primary-monitor\">question I asked on the Unix &amp; Linux SE site</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Specs:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ubuntu 10.10  w/ Gnome and Compiz  </li>\n<li>8GB RAM  </li>\n<li>AMD Phenom II 965 Black Edition  </li>\n<li>Asus M4A79 Deluxe mobo  </li>\n<li>XFX ATI Radeon HD 5750 w/ 1GB RAM  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>VLC is configured to use the hardware overlay for video (as per the default setting)</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have an idea what may cause this issue or how I may go about troubleshooting it?
