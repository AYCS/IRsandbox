They worked well, I could switch  them with the quirky <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> combination, but up until the point I tried to run Unity alongside Gnome. Mind you, it worked (kind of) - I got the Unity dock etc, but only on the root account. </p>\n\n<p>But then I changed my mind. I didn't want Unity, after all. I uninstalled it by typing <code>sudo apt-get remove --purge unity</code> and <code>sudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-desktop</code>, which, as I have later found out, uninstalled Nautilus and other useful things. I had to do a lot of rebooting and reconfiguring (so much that I can't remember) to make things work again, and when I needed the Russian keyboard, I found out that I couldn't change to it.
