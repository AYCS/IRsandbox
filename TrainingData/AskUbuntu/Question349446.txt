Here is a sequence of what I did:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Installed Windows XP onto 20gb of hard-drive space</p></li>\n<li><p>Installed Ubuntu 11.10 onto the remaining 10 gb of space using the advance setup option where I partitioned: (1gb swap, 200mb /boot, and 8.8gb / , (see screenshot))</p></li>\n<li><p>Trouble struck, when I rebooted, grub2 didn't show Windows XP under my boot options.</p></li>\n<li><p>I ran sudo update-grub but it still didn't find windows</p></li>\n<li><p>I opened gparted and added the 'boot' flag to my windows xp partition (I was getting desperate and didn't know what to do)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And now, I'm stuck with only Ubuntu, and I don't want to have to re-install both Ubuntu and Windows to get grub working again. </p>\n\n<p>Please note, I have seen <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/162878/how-to-boot-windows-xp-no-grub-menu-is-shown\">How to boot Windows XP (no GRUB menu is shown)?</a> and <a href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/110698/add-windows-to-my-boot-menu\">Add windows to my boot menu</a> but I couldn't find anything useful. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot,</p>\n\n<p>DevNewb</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":575265,"title":"After Installing Win XP, could not able to load Ubuntu 14.04","body":"<p>My System was having Windows XP in <code>C:</code> drive, then I installed Ubuntu in <code>F:</code> Drive.
