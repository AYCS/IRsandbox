I am not playing with any alarm lists, I only want one alarm to be set at a time, but I want to be able to unset alarm that is in progress. It works fine, again until the current time equals the alarm time (rounded to minutes) when removing alarm logically doesn't work, as it's time format is \"Tue 2013-09-17 10:56:00\" (seconds always to zero), so it is already passed during that minute, but it is still visible in the <em>event list</em> (ok, it belongs to that minute) and it notifies me if I set a new alarm (this is what I don't understand).</p>\n\n<p>So to sum it up:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Setting an alarm does not work properly, I can see it in the list but it does not notify me at all (not even when the minute passes, it just disappears from the <em>event list</em>).</li>\n<li>If its time equals current time (in minutes) and if I set new alarm at that time, the old one suddenly wakes up and notifies me.\n<ul>\n<li>Another odd thing is that when I do that, there is a full date shown for the old playing alarm in the <em>event list</em>, like \"Tue 10:56\" or \"09-17 10:56\", while if I set a new alarm, only time with no date is displayed, like \"10:56\".</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even the example on Ubuntu Developer web doesn't work:\n<a href=\"http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/Ubuntu.Components.Alarm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/sdk-14.10/Ubuntu.Components.Alarm/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is my partially modified code suffering from the same bug:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import QtQuick 2.3\nimport Ubuntu.Components 1.1\nimport Ubuntu.Components.Pickers 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    objectName: \"mainView\"\n    applicationName: \"com.ubuntu.developer.username.alarmtest\"\n    useDeprecatedToolbar: false\n\n    width: units.gu(100)\n    height: units.gu(75)\n\n    Page {\n        title: i18n.tr(\"Simple\")\n\n        Alarm{\n            id: alarm\n            onStatusChanged: {\n                if(status == Alarm.Ready) {\n                    button.text = \"Set Alarm\";\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        Column {\n            spacing: units.gu(1)\n            Row {\n                spacing: units.gu(1)\n                Label {\n                    id: date\n                    text: \"Date:\"\n                    anchors.verticalCenter: parent.verticalCenter\n                }\n                DatePicker {\n                    id: datePicker\n                    date: new Date()\n                    mode: \"Hours|Minutes\"\n                    onDateChanged: {\n                        var pickerDate = datePicker.date;\n                        pickerDate.setSeconds(0);\n                        datePicker.date = pickerDate;\n                    }\n                }\n                Button {\n                    id: button\n                    text: \"Set Alarm\";\n                    onClicked: {\n                        if ((alarm.operation &gt; Alarm.NoOperation) &amp;&amp; (alarm.operation &lt; Alarm.Reseting)) {\n                            reset();\n                        }\n                        else {\n                            alarm.date = new Date(datePicker.date);\n                            alarm.message = \"My alarm\";\n                            alarm.save();\n                            if (alarm.error != Alarm.NoError)\n                                print(\"Error saving alarm, code: \" + alarm.error + \" at time \" + alarm.date);\n                            text = \"Unset Alarm\";\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And my question is, is it normal that it doesn't work or am I doing something wrong?
