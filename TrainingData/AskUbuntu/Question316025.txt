nvidia graphic card. i installed some packages off line by using dpkg and also some programs from source code. now i have problem installing wine on my system. i have tried these commands:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo apt-get update</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo apt-get install wine1.7</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>but it gives me this:</p>\n\n<p>The following information may help to resolve the situation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>The following packages have unmet dependencies:\n wine1.7 : Depends: wine1.7-i386 (=

many unrelated packages and not installing wine.\ni don't know how resolve this dependecy problem. i could install wine on newly installed ubuntu but in my case i don't know what packages are causing this problem. i also tried other version of wine such as wine <code>wine1.6</code> <code>wine1.4</code> <code>wine1.3</code>. i also tried installing wine from source code but it only can run non gui applications.</p>\n"}]}]
