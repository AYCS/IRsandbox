Artistx is apparently a different OS and downloaded Ubuntu 12.1.\nSo while trying to open Ubuntu, I got the error that gave me the low graphics card error. I did what was supposed to fix this, but my terminal wouldn't work with anything or do anything to fix this after searching the error. I got the error that my Harddrive was full and I had no memory left (for some reason artistx has my memory at 11GB/11GB even though I have a 650 GB Hard drive that Ubuntu won't use because it's HP or something). I don't have a windows recovery disk, and im not sure what else to do. When GRUB loads, it gives a list of Ubuntu, memory test, and a windows vista with sda 1 and sda 2 by them. I can email a picture if this to you if you'd like. If you could help in any way, it would be so helpful.
