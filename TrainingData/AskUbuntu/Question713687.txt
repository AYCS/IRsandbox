after unplugging), while the battery still reports 99% charge and drops from 2:30 hr to 1:30 hr, the energy usage goes from 8.34 W to 13.54 W and the current_now increases, but shouldn't it be using less energy in battery mode since the screen is much dimmer and it's in power saving mode? (or is that normal behavior?)</p>\n\n<p>It also seems to drain more quickly than what it predicts, especially with the 1-1.25 hour drop in the first minute of being unplugged, which seems odd.</p>\n\n<p>What really concerns me is that Ubuntu 12.10 may not be properly managing the battery (with the sudden change in charge/life from 2:30 to 1:30 or 1:15 within a minute of unplugging), and that a new battery may quickly die under Ubuntu 12.10.</p>\n\n<p>I'd greatly appreciate any advice/suggestions on what to do, and especially whether there's a way to get back the 1-1.5 hrs of battery life that were suddenly lost when changing from WinXp to Ubuntu 12.10.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks :)</p>\n"},{"id":232358,"title":"How to make Ubuntu recognize Samsung galaxy battery level?","body":"<p>When I plug in an iPhone device, it automatically charges the battery, and showing battery's power percentage. </p>\n\n<p>How to do so, with an Android device?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/iI6Yd.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"},{"id":217895,"title":"The battery indicator&amp; Power setting panel shows wrong battery state","body":"<p>My laptop is Thinkpad E420 with Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit installed, the kernel version is 3.2.0-33-generic.\nI have set the battery threshold as 60% via windows7.
