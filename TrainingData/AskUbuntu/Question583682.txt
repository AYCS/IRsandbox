Another issue I have is sometimes my system freezes(turns black &amp; white) for a few seconds sometimes minutes pus I notice my PC is very slow sometimes, I also see this when i check my HDD \"Disk is OK, 2 bad sectors (35° C / 95° F)\".. Not sure if all these problems are related to the \"failed to D/L Repository info\" message, if not, any help/suggestions or info on any or all of these problems would be appreciated.. NOTE: I do have a lot of software installed like steam, wine, utorrent, etc.. and some web/software dev tools besides the partitions it says I’m only using close to 18% of my HDD.. Anyone please help if you need more info plz let me know.. oh btw I think I originally installed V.14.04 via bootable stick then upgraded to 15.04 through software updater.. if this helps..
