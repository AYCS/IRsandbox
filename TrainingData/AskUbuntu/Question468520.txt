I already watched the solutions to this problem and tried them all: i checked on system32 that all the necessary .dll where there and imported the missing ones. To open Ableton live i need to open the authorization (.auz) but i didn't manage and there is no program in the \"open with\" that allows that. I don't know if adding Ableton live to the open with apps could help, but i don't know how to do that too, i tried looking in the forums but i didn't manage. Maybe this command could be useful $ wine Live.exe \"C:\\foo.auz\"  but i typed it in the terminal and did not work. As i said i am totally new to Ubuntu and don't know how to work with properly. If someone could explain me how to manage to open the .auz file and let Ableton work it would be amazing, cause i am really getting crazy and have no idea how to manage by myself. \nThank you in advance!!! </p>\n"},{"id":456226,"title":"How to install NFS mw 2 using playonlinux or wine","body":"<p>I don't see the option for NFS most wanted 2 in the install menu for playonlinux.\nDoes that mean its not supported ?\nWill it work with WINE?\nHas anybody already done it?</p>\n"},{"id":231999,"title":"How can I get rid of wine menu entries when wine packages are not uninstalled?","body":"<p>I prefer to use PlayOnLinux to configure wine and manage prefixes.</p>\n\n<p>PlayOnLinux requires wine packages to be installed, but I won't use default <code>/home/$USER/.wine</code> prefix.

I have been reading up about installing MS Office through WINE/PlayonLinux, but have been unsuccessful so far. I downloaded a MS Office 2007 package from Pirate Bay, which I extracted into a folder. I tried numerous different ways to install through WINE and PlayonLinux, but will discuss the one which seems to be getting me somewhere. <a href=\"http://www.webupd8.org/2011/01/how-to-install-microsoft-office-2007-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.webupd8.org/2011/01/how-to-install-microsoft-office-2007-in.html</a> ..... Initially, when I would click on the install button of MS Office, I get a message saying \"The install location you selected does not have 1558MB free space. Free up space from the selected install location or choose a different install location\". The install location in this case said \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\", which confused me as I don't have drives named as C, Z etc. I went to configure WINE and under the drives tab, created a drive named A with the path location /media/cd025f16-433b-4a90-abb6-bb7a025d0450/. Also the space thing is confusing as I have at least 450GB of unused space on my computer.</p>\n\n<p>anyways, when I selected the A drive for installation, the installation starts, but soon I get the following error message, \"Office cannot find Office.en-us\\OfficeLR.Cab. Browse to a valid installation source\" .... The part saying \"OfficeLR.Cab\" have said different things after the Office bit every time I have made an attempt. When I select the Office.en-us sub-folder or any other folder within the folder where MS Office 2007 is saved, it says \"invalid source\"!</p>\n\n<p>I have been trying to get this sorted since 15hrs now (addictive!) and have learnt loads of things in the process, but have not managed to crack it. It might be something stupidly simple I am not aware off that is stopping it.</p>\n\n<p>I would really appreciate some help! Thanks a lot.. Also I am still getting used to the language, so might have many questions</p>\n\n<p>Also I am using Ubuntu 11.04 (tag 11.04). Also I think I don't have windows -- when my friend installed Ubuntu on my new laptop which had Windows 7, he was trying to keep windows in a separate partition, but something happened and windows was not there! </p>\n\n<p>Looking forward to some support! Again thanks a lot</p>\n"}]}]
