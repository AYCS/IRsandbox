The things I have tried: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shut down and disconnect the printer before installing packages.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>ppa:michael-gruz/canon</code> repository to synaptic and installed the <code>cnijfilter-pixmaip1000series</code> package (there is no package for 1300 so I installed the nearest one). The PPA repository does not have packages for Quantal, so had to manually update the repository definition to \"Oneiric\" and refreshed it before downloading. </li>\n<li>Restarted cups via <code>sudo service cups restart</code>.</li>\n<li>Connected and switched on the printer.</li>\n<li>Opened All Settings -> Printers to Add a printer. There are 2 entries - One for the Standard USB Printer, another for \"USB Printer - With Status Readback for Canon IJ\" with Device URL as <code>cnijusb:/dev/usb/lp1</code>.
