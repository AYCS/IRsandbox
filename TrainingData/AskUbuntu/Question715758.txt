This desktop has 7 GB of RAM, dual core processor(AMD Athlon X2), 256 MB Graphics card and around 1.7 TB of hard drive...overall good configuration to run Ubuntu into Xwindows mode(default Ubuntu Desktop). How i can upgrade to the Ubuntu Desktop 14.0.4 or Ubuntu Desktop 15.x? What i am seeing is a very basic CLI kind of interface after using this mini.iso....Moreover my keyboard is not fully mapped it seems...how to fix that?</p>\n\n<p>Bottomline i need to get into the XWindows mode(default ubuntu Desktop) and then use this as a regular Ubuntu Desktop system. CLI is very limited according to me.</p>\n\n<p>Found some other issues with mini.iso installation - because it's more like a command line installation....good amount of manual stuff(selection of packages etc... required on my side)...Keyboard layout was wrongly set..and some other issues.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":620233,"title":"upgrade 12.10 to later version","body":"<p>I followed the directions.
