It was functioning normally for at least 3 days before I noticed that Youtube videos were flickering on my screen in Chromium. My first thought was to update flash, and since flash comes with the latest version of chrome, I tried updating my Chromium installation. At first I tried using the Chromium Updater Extension, but it didn't solve the problem. It was somewhere around this time that Chromium stopped opening completely. I then tried uninstalling and reinstalling Chromium, but it still wouldn't open. I tried running the program from the command line, but got a message involving \"libudev.so.0\" being missing from the operating system. I believe after this I had to leave so I shut down the computer.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I tried loading the Ubuntu installation, only to see that it was stuck on the purple screen. After waiting a while, I tried restarting it and loading it again. This time, it only booted to a black screen with a blinking line at the top left of the screen, much like a terminal window. I tried removing all the non essential USB devices but it still wouldn't boot. </p>\n\n<p>I did attempt to use the Boot-Repair Graphical Tool, but it said that it encoutered an error and gave me this link: <a href=\"http://paste.ubuntu.com/7306456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://paste.ubuntu.com/7306456/</a> .  Ubuntu still won't boot at this point, and I'd rather not have to reinstall it a third time. I did try Repairing Grub2 via the live CD terminal as accoridng to this page: <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_the_LiveCD_terminal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_the_LiveCD_terminal</a> , but i'm a bit nervous about removing the Grub entirely. Won't that make it difficult for me to boot windows? Also, I can't remember exactly when but I got that same message about libudev.so.0 being missing again at some point when trying to boot. Probably after using Boot-Repair.</p>\n\n<p>April 23 - I did try enabling boot messages to see if anything useful came up, and I got two messages at the very end that looked important.</p>\n\n<p><code>ureadahead main process (312) terminated with status 5\nmountall main process (319) terminated with status 127</code></p>\n\n<p>I did try looking up solutions, but the ones I found sounded very sketchy and all over the place.</p>\n"},{"id":440576,"title":"Ubuntu 12.04 Dual Boot fails to load (black screen)","body":"<p>I have a dual boot Windows 7 + Ubuntu 12.04 system (64 bit).  About a week ago, using GRUB to load into Ubuntu resulted in a freeze at the loading screen.  I could still run into recovery mode, so using the console from that I tried a few solutions I found on the web.\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get upgrade\n    sudo apt-get install fglrx\n    sudo aticonfig --initial\n    sudo reboot\nNo luck there. Then I tried updating the Nvidia drivers (GTX 760):</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia-*\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Still nothing. In fact, now I just get a black screen with a blinking cursor when I boot into Ubuntu regularly.  I can still boot into recovery mode, and can not find a solution.  Text appears when I shut down off the blinking cursor screen  (it turns purple, and says something like \"terminating ubuntu\").  I am a new user to linux, and the most advanced thing I've done in terminal is using the nano editor.</p>\n\n<p>This may be important, so about a week before this error started, I used a partition tool to increase Ubuntu's main partition to 100 gigs.  After that, both Ubuntu and Windows still worked normally, until the error described above.  Windows still works fine (Posting this question while in Windows on the same machine).</p>\n"},{"id":399139,"title":"Black screen when booting Ubuntu after GRUB","body":"<p>So I installed Ubuntu 13.10 as the primary OS on my laptop. I installed Windows 8 in another partition and set up GRUB to be the boot loader. Eventually I updated Windows and it became a black screen so I reinstalled Windows in that partition. Somehow doing this removed Windows from GRUB's menu and so I tried to reinstall GRUB which I had a little trouble doing. I tried it a few different ways, one of them was booting from a LiveCD and involved mounting and unmounting things (did this pretty much blindly as I don't have a lot of the know how). That didn't work but I came across the standard boot-repair program and it worked fine.</p>\n\n<p>The big problem I have no is that Ubuntu does not load after selecting it from GRUB. It just hangs at a black screen. When I select recovery mode, it goes to the menu. When I resume the normal boot, it reads out:</p>\n\n<p><code>Ubuntu 13.10 Denjay-Laptop tty1</code></p>\n\n<p><code>Denjay-Laptop login:_</code></p>\n\n<p>With a flashing underscore. After a few seconds it then adds to that line <code>initct1: Event failed</code></p>\n\n<p>I also checked all the file systems with the recovery mode and with a LiveCD and nothing was anomalous on that end. I've also gone through updating GRUB so I think something wrong post-GRUB if that makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>I heard that it might be a video card problem so I tried <code>nomodeset</code> which still resulted in a black screen. One user had too many drivers installed on their card and they input <code>dpkg --get-selections nvidia-*</code> to show their drivers. My laptop has \"amd a8 3520m apu with radeon tm hd graphics\" and I'm not sure what the driver package name for that is. So what should I replace <code>nvidia</code> with for to get the driver?</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"id":379915,"title":"Problems Booting Ubuntu 12.04 on Dual Boot with Windows 8","body":"<p>I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside pre-installed Windows 8.
