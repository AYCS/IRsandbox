But after a restart I had no network. When i did ifconfig ethx/wlanx up it gave an error message.\nI had to remove the new kernel and reboot the old kernel to get the network back.</p>\n\n<p>How do I keep the network drivers between kernels? Does not the dependencies hop along between kernels?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps a better question would be - what are the appropriate steps to install a kernel and keeping the drivers working between kernel-generations? If there is a manual I would read it, but I have not found Potters book of knowledge where all the magick Linux are collected in one large volume. In this case I would like to read the chapter <em>x.x.x.IV Kernel Update do and do not.</em></p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":712013,"title":"How to have network device driver r8168 installed automatically when a new kernel is installed","body":"<p>I am using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on my desktop and am using the integrated Realtek ethernet networking on my Gigabyte motherboard.

As OS, I want to dual-boot to Windows 7 and Ubuntu (KUbuntu more precisely). \nAt no point did I think there would be an issue with Linux and this MB, but I found some threads/reviews where people were complaining either about the UEFI booting or about not supported drivers for Killer 2400 network card.\nMy current set-up is a dual-boot win7 with ubuntu, but it's a pre UEFI era, so I have no issues with not supported drivers or booting.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, my questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Will I be able to safely dual-boot to win7 and my choice of Linux distro?</li>\n<li>Will Ubuntu detect my Killer 2400 network card out of the box?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>cheers. </p>\n\n<p>P.S.

Set up the PC and successfully installed win 7. It wasn't as easy as it should though, due to the fact the z170 chipset has some issues with win 7 installation: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Microsoft is removing support for the EHCI host controller (USB 2.0\n  spec) and keeping only the xHCI host controller spec</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyway, that's as far as I got. Did boot into Kubuntu live DVD, and confirmed that internet is running, so the E2400 network card at least is supported.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I'll fire off the installation and hopefully I'll have dual-boot without issues.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: I finally did it.
