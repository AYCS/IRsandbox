[{"id":715126,"title":"Ubuntu/Grub Not leaving Boot Menu (Win 10)","body":"<p>I've scoured the internet trying to fix this.  Browsed every possible solution from questions answered on this page but I simply can not remove ubuntu/grub fully from my PC.</p>\n\n<p>So, I originally started off with simply Win 10 and wanted to add on ubuntu as a dual boot.  I shrunk my C: Partition by 30 GB and installed ubuntu onto its own 30GB partition.  Eventually I just didn't really use Ubuntu anymore so I went about uninstalling it.  First I went onto Windows and Uninstalled the program Ubuntu from the Programs/Features List.  I followed up by wiping the partition it was installed on.  Converting that Partition to unallocated space, then re-adding it to my C drive.</p>\n\n<p>Current Partitions: \nWill post link in comments, can only have 2 links since my rep is low.</p>\n\n<p>It seemed all was fine until I rebooted my PC.  I was greeted by the Grub menu.  So Following seeing that, I rebooted and checked my boot menu.  And for some odd reason ubuntu was still there.</p>\n\n<p>Current Boot Menu: \n<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/8B3V0xt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/8B3V0xt.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>Here's when I started clicking on all the different Askubuntu questions and looking for a solution.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried (and with no luck):\nFactory Image Restore</p>\n\n<p>Command Prompt in startup: <code>bootrec</code> <code>/fixmbr</code> <code>/fixboot</code> etc...</p>\n\n<p>Using 3rd Party Software like EasyBCD</p>\n\n<p>BCDEdit: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/xYk6gco.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/xYk6gco.png</a></p>\n\n<p>Msconfig: Will post link in comments</p>\n\n<p>Windows Startup Repair</p>\n\n<p>So with all that spew out of the way, is there any way to simply get my windows back by itself?  Modern PC's don't give recovery disks anymore which is BS so I can't just do a full drive wipe and reinstall windows without having to spend another $80 or so.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any tips, I really just want to get grub/ubuntu off of this pc since I'm trying to sell it soon.</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":705059,"title":"Edit boot menu from Ubuntu on a laptop with Win 8","body":"<p>I have a problem that is giving me a headache for months and I hope that in this, my first question here, you can help me out.</p>\n\n<p>I have been trying to install Ubuntu on a laptop with a default win 8 system. I has taken a while but I have managed. The only resulting problem was that when I start my computer I can only access a boot menu where Ubunty appears if I press F9.</p>\n\n<p>In order to get a decent boot menu I have learnt that Win 8 is messing around very badly and being evil as Microsoft does so well. I have tried to go through this jungle of unknown terms for me (UEFI, Grub, etc.) and the difficulties that Win 8 creates when I found a little piece of software for Win 8 that apparently would solve my problems allowing to edit the boot menu so I get what I have. It's called EasyBCD 2.2.0.182.</p>\n\n<p>I'm sure it's a good programme when used by wise hands. However, I managed to create a menu with a few options where none of them would be valid! I could only access Ubuntu through the esc key but I can't access windows anymore.</p>\n\n<p>So, is there a way I can edit the boot menu from Ubuntu? Maybe using the Win software I mentioned from Ubuntu (I believe this can be done) to undo the problematic menu I created?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!!</p>\n\n<p>Carlos</p>\n"},{"id":704642,"title":"Skip Grub at boot","body":"<p>I installed Ubuntu in an empty disk in an UEFI machine, and has been booting directly without any kind of menu or timeout until last week's software update.
