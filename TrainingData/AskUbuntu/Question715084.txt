I have a couple leads below, any ideas on what the problem is, or what I can do? Is there a better suggestion? \n <a href=\"http://zachstechnotes.blogspot.com/2012/04/post-title.html\">http://zachstechnotes.blogspot.com/2012/04/post-title.html</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/issues/77\">https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/issues/77</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/issues/522\">https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/issues/522</a></p>\n\n<p>Also, here are some of my files (let me know if there is a better configuration - the only change I made was uncommenting the \"BusID PCI:01:00.0\" in the <code>xorg.conf.nvidia</code> file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>lucas@lucas-ThinkPad-W520:~$ more /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia \nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier  \"Layout0\"\n    Option      \"AutoAddDevices\" \"false\"\n    Option      \"AutoAddGPU\" \"false\" EndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"DiscreteNvidia\"\n    Driver      \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName  \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n\n#   If the X server does not automatically detect your VGA device,\n#   you can manually set it here.\n#   To get the BusID prop, run `lspci | egrep 'VGA|3D'` and input the data\n#   as you see in the commented example.\n#   This Setting may be needed in some platforms with more than one\n#   nvidia card, which may confuse the proprietary driver (e.g.,\n#   trying to take ownership of the wrong device).
