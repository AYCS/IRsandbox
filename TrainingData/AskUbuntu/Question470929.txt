So far no major problems. But then I though about connecting a second bluetooth speaker.</p>\n\n<p>I use the bluetooth connection provided by a Kensington bluetooth v4.0 dongle, but when I tried to connect the 2 speakers, the second one connected and disconnected immediately. After some research I concluded that my bluetooth interface only supports one A2DP streaming simultaneously, so the solution was or to buy a multi-stream dongle (not sure if those exist) or trying to use a second bluetooth dongle on parallel (that's what I'm trying).</p>\n\n<p>My idea was the following: I connect speaker 1 to dongle 1, I connect speaker 2 to dongle 2, I configure pulseaudio to stream to both speakers simultaneously, then I sit and relax. Well... I cannot make it work.</p>\n\n<p>I see the 2 hci0 and hci1 when I run hciconfig, but when together I cannot detect any devices. I tried disabling one of the dongles with hciconfig to connect with the other one and test, but it doesn't work. Both dongles work perfectly if they are connected alone on the PC, but I cannot make them work simultaneously. I also tried blueman but I get the same behavior that from command line.
