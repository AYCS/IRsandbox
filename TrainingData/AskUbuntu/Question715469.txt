Firefox 3.x worked fine also from a VNC session.\nI tried to turn off the hardware acceleration from the Firefox preferences, but that doesn't fix the problem.</p>\n\n<p><code>firefox --sync</code>, <code>firefox -safe-mode</code> and <code>firefox -ProfileManager</code> also crash the same way.</p>\n\n<p>Any idea how to troubleshoot this? Thanks.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: additional info.</p>\n\n<p>I run vnc (RealVNC 4.1.1) from xinetd, this is the config I use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>service Xvnc\n{\n        type = UNLISTED\n        disable = no\n        socket_type = stream\n        protocol = tcp\n        wait = yes\n        user = root\n        server = /usr/bin/Xvnc4\n        server_args = -inetd :1 -desktop vnc5901 -query localhost -geometry 1160x675 -depth 16 -once -DisconnectClients=0 -NeverShared passwordFile=/path/to/vnc/password -render\n        port = 5901\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}]}]
