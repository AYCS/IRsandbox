However, I really like the way Unity spreads all open windows on a workspace when you press Super+w. I like that you do not need to keep holding Super+w to navigate the displayed windows, and that you can close windows from that setting, rather than going back to the ordinary view and closing them. I also like that there are big images of the current windows, rather than the little images shown in the window switcher in Mate.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, does there exist a gui, well supported with Ubuntu, that has a similar window spreading feature, but that in other respects is similar to Mate? I really like everything else about Mate.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, the computer I currently have available for Mate does not do well with Compiz, so maybe running Mate with Compiz is the answer, which I will have the hardware for soon.</p>\n"},{"id":701707,"title":"Restore Unity after uninstalling Mate","body":"<p>I have Ubuntu 15.10. Recently I wanted to try Mate so I installed. But after installing it I noticed that some Unity elements behavior changed.</p>\n\n<p>Typically I found that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When I scroll over the icon on the top-right of the screen representing the sound volume, I don't see the scale indicating the volume changed as I used to.</li>\n<li>An error message is shown whenever I login to my account, this message shows that I some applications cannot access my account information. This message is because I changed one of my social media accounts password. So it's an expected message. But what's not expected is that the look and feel of the shown dialog has changed, it shows an orange strip on one of it's side. In the past it was just a gray hovering tooltip look-alike thing which visually integrated well with Unity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So my question is how to restore how Unity behaved like before installing Mate without having to completely reset it and lose my settings and configurations such as the shortcuts I created on the Unity launcher ?</p>\n\n<p>If reinstalling Unity is the only solution I'm willing to do it. I found someone posting the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall unity\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But they seemed risky.
