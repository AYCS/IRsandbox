I installed version 14.04 LTS on my system which already has 13.10 on it which works fine (except I cant do any updates or install any new packages so thats why I tried 14.04) except unless I boot into recovery mode, the system freezes, and I notice when I go to \"system settings\", then \"details\" it doesnt list a graphics selection like on my 13.10 instance...Therefor Im assuming its a graphics that didnt get detected during install.  And I dont know how to fix it.  I have booted into recovery mode and went thru the area to reconfigure the graphics but it doesnt let me do anything and it tells me Im running in low graphics mode.
