Previous to this I was using Ubuntu 14.04 and had lots of unwanted documents, images, videos etc and also had picked up a few viruses. I decided the easiest way to go about resolving this issue was to do a complete clean install of Ubuntu. I downloaded the Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS ISO (64 bit) from here: <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop</a> and created a bootable USB using the 'Startup Disk Creator' tool that comes pre-installed with Ubuntu on a brand-new 8 gigabyte USB. I then booted from this, installed the OS and installed the latest updates  with no issues. However, the only issue I have noticed is that my laptop will not wake from suspend. (Please Note that this was an issue present on the laptop before the clean install but I thought it was down to one of said viruses.) I know that this is a known issue but I though that this would have been fixed folllowing the latest updates. Does anyone know any way around these issues? </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>I should have mentioned that:</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Upon opening the lid/clicking the power button once to resume from suspend:</strong>\nAll is can see is a blank, black screen with my cursor which cannot be moved. No key provides a response apart from the power key to preform a hard reset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>-Using the Terminal to suspend and resume:</strong>\nIf I were to use the command <code>sudo pm-suspend</code> the laptop will suspend and resume before showing me the screen which I had entered the command on (shows the terminal and any other windows that were currently visible when command was executed) but I cannot interact with this in any way. Again, the only button that responds is the power key in order to preform a hard reset.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>PREVIOUS FIXES ATTEMPTS</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I have tried using a script that made the graphics card do a reboot (Using chvt1 and chvt7 I believe) but this just made the laptop unable to suspend at all.
