Bear this in mind. </p>\n\n<p>I've converted back to Ubuntu after over a year of the misery that is windows 8. I'm running a tiny, craptastic Acer Aspire One, have downloaded Chrome, and now I can't seem to get any sound out of any flash videos I play (youtube, streaming via free tv, etc). I've tried everything listed in the open forums (updating flash, top ten things to do after installing 14.10), but nothing seems to be working. I'm not certain if it's a sound card issue (again, being as green as grass to this particular iteration of Ubuntu), but any help would be greatly appreciated (so that I can go back to watching Downton Abbey and stop clogging up the forum). </p>\n"},{"id":511385,"title":"No sound on any web browser","body":"<p>I was using my laptop to play Youtube on my TV.

Occasionally the sound of the Flash player breaks and remains broken until I restart my system. This happens <em>especially</em> often when I play videos from <code>epicfail dot com</code>. Like every second video or so.</p>\n\n<p>By \"broken\" I mean that it sounds like... er... well... farting. While it does seem to have something to do with the actual video sound (in terms of volume for example) it is absolutely unintelligible. </p>\n\n<p>When the Flash sound is broken, it is broken for every flash instance - videos, games, etc. Restarting the browser or shift-esc -> plugin-shockwave-flash-> end-process does NOT fix it. The sound in other applications (Rhythmbox, Movie Player, Installed games) works fine. Only Flash seems to be affected.</p>\n\n<p>Restarting the computer fixes it (until it gets broken again). So far it hasn't happened if I'm watching Youtube videos or playing Kongregate games. Epicfail is the surest way to break it, and it does happen every once in a while after a Wimp video.</p>\n\n<p>So, has anyone experienced this? Is there a way of fixing it, or if not, at least getting it to work again without having to restart my machine?</p>\n"},{"id":302506,"title":"Sound/Video playing in slow motion on 12.04 with Bluetooth + Chrome, but not Firefox","body":"<p>I have been using the same Plantronics BT Headset with my HP laptop and BT USB dongle running 12.04 since 12.04 came out. Just in the last week or two I have started to have a problem where playing sound through the headset when in Chrome causes the sound (and video if watching Youtube or similar) to play in slow motion. If I switch off of the BT headset and keep playing the sound, it stays in slow motion. If I refresh the page, it plays properly. I've noticed this happening with Google Hangouts too.</p>\n\n<p>Trying things in FF seems to be fine, and switching Youtube to HTML5 doesn't seem to help. This problem seems to coincide with a change to Ubuntu that has given me two BT icons in my task bar instead of one. I tried researching why that happened and came up empty there too. This could be a straight up chrome issue, but I thought I would go the Ubuntu + BT route for investigation first.</p>\n"}]}]
