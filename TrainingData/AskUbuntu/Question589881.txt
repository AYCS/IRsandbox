For example, fonts on all the dialogue boxes change, the colors of the tile bars change, etc. It gives me a warning for some kind of system error, but it won't tell me anything about it, and submitting it can't to much given that my internet also doesn't seem to be working. I have tried rebooting, and even using earlier versions of Ubuntu. It doesn't help. Also, there doesn't seem to be any way to turn off the computer through the menus. If I click the icon in the corner and select shut down, it asks me whether I want to lock or log off. If I log off, there's a button to shutdown, which brings up a box asking if I want to shutdown with no buttons.</p>\n"},{"id":542216,"title":"Cursor theme does not change in Ubuntu 14.10","body":"<p>Maybe it's my fault, I don't remember.

In case you don't want to follow the link it works something like this:</p>\n\n<p>1) Run <code>sudo update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme</code> This changes the \"default\" pointer.</p>\n\n<p>2) Launch <code>dconf-editor</code> and change <code>org.gnome.desktop.interface.cursor-theme</code> to the theme you want.</p>\n\n<p>Even more condensed we have:</p>\n\n<p>1) Set the X11 pointer</p>\n\n<p>2) Set the GTK/Gnome/Unity Pointer</p>\n\n<p>So here's the rub: using these methods, I can set the size for GTK/Gnome, but the update-alternatives method just allows for changing the theme, not the size. </p>\n\n<p>The feeling I get from reading various forums seems to be \"just install a different cursor theme which has the size you want as a default.\" Is this actually the current state of affairs? </p>\n\n<p>P.S.
