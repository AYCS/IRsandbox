Have to say that it does take quite some getting used to after using Windows 7 but it looks great and I think I'm getting the feel for it. Except for a couple of issues.</p>\n\n<p>For example: I am an experienced GIMP user, and even make money with it. I had a lot of additional scripts/brushes/fonts/etc added to my GIMP when using Windows 7. Before switching OS I made a backup of those files on my external drive. Now I want to put those back into the GIMP installation in Ubuntu.</p>\n\n<p>How do I go about this? I have located the GIMP entry in the 'share' folder, but am not allowed to copy any files to it, the system says I'm not the 'root'. I'm probably doing it wrong; Ubuntu is a whole other world than Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nIn general, I might also ask the following question, which will help me with the above and just about all my other issues:\n- Where are my programs located? In other words: What is in Ubuntu, what 'program files' is in Windows? And are there differences between the two? Can you edit files in Ubuntu like you can in Windows?</p>\n\n<p>Why I'm asking this, is: a lot of stuff you can download from the web comes with a description similar to \"download this and put the file in .../.../.../...\" Since a lot of programs do not run on Ubuntu, placing in the files manually is the only remaining way to do it, like with the GIMP utilities. Or is there another way?</p>\n"},{"id":14302,"title":"Write dd image to disk","body":"<p>Before I installed Ubuntu on my old computer, I took backups of both partitions with dd.
