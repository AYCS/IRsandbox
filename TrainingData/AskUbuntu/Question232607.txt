My setup currently consists of using mac osx and vmware (windows 7) to run one program that isn't compatible with osx or linux.  This program can be run using crossover (wine) as well but it works better with vmware.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking of switching over to ubuntu as my main operating system on my computers and running vmware or crossover that way to access the program I need.  No specific reason why, I guess I'm just sick of the apple/windows machine.  I've always wanted to try linux so figure there is no better time than now.  The point is I haven't used ubuntu yet so I don't know a lot about it.</p>\n\n<p>I was planning on buying the iphone 5 when I saw there is an app to setup ubuntu operating system on an android phone.  I'm now thinking that this would be fantastic for me if I bought the samsung galaxy note 2 and was able to install ubuntu and either vmware or crossover to use my windows specific program for work right on my phone.  The samsung galaxy note 2 has a 1.4 ghz processor and 2gb of ram which is enough to handle a modern operating system.  My program does not need a lot of speed or memory to work.  To be honest, the windows specific program I need would work fine on an old laptop running windows xp.</p>\n\n<p>My first question is if ubuntu for android is really the full operating system that lets you run programs just like a desktop pc? Is it super slow where it takes many minutes to load up ubuntu?  I don't need blazing speeds, but I'd like something useable. </p>\n\n<p>My next question has to do with vmware or crossover.  Is ubuntu for android capable of running these programs?</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be great to use the same operating system like ubuntu on my desktop, laptop, tablets, and phone. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much for all the help!!!</p>\n"}]}]
