I work a lot with audio recordings, and noticed difficulties when I started trying to record and annotate audio files in Ubuntu rather than Windows.  I use Praat (phonetics software) for much of my work, and the program will crash my system when attempting to record in my Ubuntu install.  I also use Audacity, and have noticed that most of the selections for playback and recording devices are not functional (I will be unable to record and/or unable to listen).  I've also noticed that when I play around with the input/output device selections in Audacity, it will often cause there to be no sound available in system at all ... only a reboot will return sound to normal, and even then, it doesn't necessarily work immediately.  For example, I recently used Audacity, played around with the device selection, and then had no system sound.  Upon reboot, I still had no sound until I attempted a sound test of my analogue audio output, and then sound returned. Only analogue output will play sounds during an audio test.  I would really like to better understand how audio is set up in Ubuntu, so I can hopefully use Linux for working with audio files.
