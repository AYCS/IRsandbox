(while, there is a 5.1-analogue output option, which I tried while the laptop was connected with the spdif cable and obviously nothing happened) So even though I played video files with multichannel sound (6Channel AC3 and DTS) the audio reached the receiver as 2-Channel PCM. I tried playing the files through different players (Movie Player, VLC, SMplayer) but nothing changed. </p>\n\n<p>So, here's hoping someone could help me figure out whether this is a software/driver problem (and if so, how and if I could possibly fix it) or a hardware problem, for instance that, maybe, my sound card can output spdif but only for 2Ch. Audio (which would be weird but possible I guess) and in which case, I suppose, I can't do much more than accept my defeat!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance to anyone that answers! :)</p>\n"},{"id":61299,"title":"How do I check how much physical RAM I am using in GB or MB format?","body":"<p>How do I check my whether my Ubuntu is 32-bit or 64-bit and whether or not it is using full RAM?
