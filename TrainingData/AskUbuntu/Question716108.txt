[{"id":716108,"title":"Screen recorder Ubuntu Precise 12.04 while using chromebook","body":"<p>This same question was posed back in May 2015 under \"Trying to screen record on Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 while using chromebook\", but the community did not answer it.</p>\n\n<p>I am another user that is having the same exact problem. I am running Ubuntu Precise 12.04 xfce4 via crouton on an HP Chromebook 14 (Intel). I have tried three different screen recorders (Simplescreenrecorder, Kazam, recordmydesktop) and after attempting to record it forces my monitor screen to go black. Adjusting the brightness will not work here and I have to force a reboot back into developer mode to get my Ubuntu back up. </p>\n\n<p>Is this a known bug that needs to be addressed with crouton? Is it using up too much of the CPU? I tried lowering CPU usage on the screen recorder, but it still made the monitor go black.</p>\n\n<p>Looking for some help here guys.
