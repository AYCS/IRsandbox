I'm using the os again after a long break. I downloaded 14.04 and really like it so far.  I just can't seem to get my gtx 750 ti card working.  I have to stop the xserver to install the driver.  When I switch to tty 3, using alt+ctl+f3, to run sh on the nvidia.run file that I downloaded, I get a blank screen.  This happens when switching between any console and requires a restart to fix.
