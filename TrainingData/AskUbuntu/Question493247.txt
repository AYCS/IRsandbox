The installation almost works, the page tells me to download and install Adobe Air, I clicked in \"Yes\" and wait while the Adobe Air was installed.

I downloaded the software and installed. But it had not been installed successfully and I had my processor fan running super fast and my laptop got heated in big manner. But I could not find the Mobile Partner installed in my laptop. But when I checked in the system monitor, it showed that some instances of mobile partner were running in the background. Killing those processes did not help me since those processes got started automatically again and again. For some reason I could not uninstall it too.</p>\n\n<p>The only solution I had in order to get my laptop out of the trouble was to delete the Mobile partner folder from where it had got installed into. When I deleted it, the processor fan came back into its normal speed. And also the heating problem was gone.</p>\n\n<p>But I need Mobile Partner to be installed. I got a new installer package from a friend who is already using that package successfully in his laptop.

Whereas installing Yahoo Messenger on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is nothing less than a nightmare for me. I tried almost everything from Google search to almost everything to install Yahoo Messenger on my machine but I failed everytime.</p>\n\n<p>After running a search on Google I came to know about Pidgin and Empathy. But neither I found how to use/install Pidgin and Empathy or similar software on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS nor did I find out how to configure Yahoo Messenger with these applications.</p>\n\n<p>The questions asked regarding Yahoo Messenger are quite old, so I'm asking this question in current era to find out if there is any easy way invented to install the Yahoo Messenger on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS like one might install it on any Windows machine?</p>\n"},{"id":581001,"title":"How can I install photoshop cs6 on ubuntu 14.04?

But, although I worked for years with unix ksh production scripts and user support, at the moment I need to take another break.</p>\n\n<p>I first installed 14.04 64-bit last week and just yesterday got past numerous stop/startovers to a system that seems(!) to work OK with one additional app installed. So now I'm encouraged. Breakthrough. Learned some things. Surely a popular package like TB won't be a problem. Not so, but far otherwise....</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/installing-thunderbird-linux\" rel=\"nofollow\">This page</a> from Mozilla doesn't do much after a download. It points to another page for installing onto 10.10, but that page assumes that a version of TB is already installed.</p>\n\n<p>For using a package manager, the page above simply refers you to <code>the documentation of the Linux distribution you're using</code>. I used a PPA for java yesterday for my other app.  Is that the same thing? Where is doc that explains them and how to use them on 14.04? Web search hits return all kinds of commentary, but there are 47 ways to do everything (a good thing, but...), not all of the doc is complete (assumes other knowledge), and some refers to older versions (10, 12, etc.). It makes sense to me that this function would work the same across versions, but what I assume/makes sense to me isn't always right.</p>\n\n<p>For installing outside a package manager, it gives a link to a list of the libraries needed -- but no indication how to get them. Apparently I need those, because I downloaded TB per those instructions, ran <code>~/thunderbird/thunderbird</code>, and nothing happened. I don't see an icon for it, either, which it seems is done by a package manager and which might be obtainable by other means -- but at this point I just want to get it working <em>at all</em>. The directory and files are there, but...nothing. Thought TB might be popular enough to be part of ubuntu. I'm not interested in any of the numerous apps in Launchpad, but I didn't see it there or in the Software Center.</p>\n\n<p>Then this morning, looking for more info with yet more search strings, I see a comment that TB is \"stock in 14.04\" (not just \"Lucid Lynx\"?) and to wait a few days for a \"push\" from Canonical. That sounds promising, but <strong>what does that mean</strong> in practice? Is it available somewhere in the 14.04 (64-bit) that I just installed? </p>\n\n<p>What do I need to do next? I only have the native 14.04 (64-bit) installed plus one other app. Not interested in Launchpad, if that matters.</p>\n"},{"id":459522,"title":"Run Spark in Ubuntu 14.04","body":"<p>Previously I was using Spark Instant Messenger in Ubuntu 12.04, whenever i need to start spark, just i will run the shell script by double click(In file properties changed as \"Allow executing file as Program\").</p>\n\n<p>But I Upgraded to 14.04, even if i change the properties as \"Allow executing file as Program\", Not able to run the script.\nevery time need to open the terminal and run the script.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any other way that i can run spark by double click??</p>\n\n<p>Forgive me for my poor grammar.</p>\n"},{"id":462034,"title":"Can&#180;t install Ubuntu 14.04","body":"<p>When I try to Install Ubuntu 14.04 either the x86 or 64 bit version (I´m using Windows 8.1) the Install process freezes after I choose Continue when asked about installing via internet some mp3 stuff.
