One of the things that annoyed me is that I get screen tearing while I'm watching videos in VLC or any video player.

I find switching to Intel fixing this problem but it's really annoying that I have to reboot to switch back when I decided to do graphics intensive tasks. For example, let's say I'm on Intel GPU and I get an invite on steam to play, I just have to make them wait while I reboot, so it's really not-the-best-workaround. </p>\n\n<p>Ok, how about I turn on vsync in AMD Control panel.
