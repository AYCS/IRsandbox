[{"id":715993,"title":"UbuntuStudio refuses to allow any other wallpaper / background folder besides its own?","body":"<p>The following problem has persisted since at least Ubuntu Studio 14.04...</p>\n\n<p>I want to use a folder of my own wallpaper images, as I do on other flavors of Ubuntu Linux (normally, the folder I use is in my home folder, and is named \"My_Wallpapers\" so I guess I want to make ~/MY_Wallpapers the folder for my system's background / wallpaper images.</p>\n\n<p>XFCE allows me to browse to that folder, and even allows me to select it; however, the instant that I leave the Settings Manager-> Desktop \"applet\" (if you will), the system RESTORES the wallpapers folder back to the default (/usr/share/backgrounds/ubuntustudio/). </p>\n\n<p>I have even tried to select a different folder within /usr/share/backgrounds, just to see if the wallpapers folder used needs to reside there...; still, when I leave the Desktop \"applet\" in Settings Manager, the wallpapers folder is restored back to the /ubuntustudio folder in /usr/share/backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>I am now running Ubuntu Studio 15.10, and that SAME PROBLEM is still present! My only \"workaround\" is to copy the entire contents of ~/My_ Wallpapers folder to the /usr/share/backgrounds/ubuntustudio folder, after first deleting the original contents!</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas? I know this is strictly NOT a \"Ubuntu\" issue, but rather a specific \"spin\" issue; still, someone out there MUST have at least experienced this issue by now! Am I the only one who likes to use a folder of his own wallpaper images? Or, at least CHANGE the folder of images being used (especially when it seems such a trivial thing to do...it really isn't too difficult to figure out \"how to do it\", it's just that when you TRY it, is doesn't work!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any assistance in advance!</p>\n","related_questions":[{"id":691689,"title":"How is the default auto-switching wallpaper in Unity made?
