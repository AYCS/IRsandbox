The boot appears to be ok and when it reaches the unity log in screen, the regular bar across the top is present but after I login, one screen goes black and the other shows only the old desktop background but without the taskbar or bar across the top. Ctr-Alt-T does not work, right click doesn't work although I can see the mouse position. I can get to a terminal with ctr-alt-F1. I have an ATI Firepro v7900 card and was previously using the AMD drivers for it. I have tried re-installing these, purging and reinstalling <code>fglrx</code> and no success. I have also tried resetting unity but get the error:</p>\n\n<p><code>compiz (core) - Error:plugin 'opengl' not loaded.</code>\nI then tried to install and check ccsm but when I run <code>sudo ccsm</code> I get a </p>\n\n<pre><code>gtkWarning: could not open display followed by some info and then AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_default_screen'.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm happy to try whatever I need to from the terminal to try and understand what is going on but it is very frustrating at the moment.\nI have tried running xserver but this fails, I have also installed gnome-shell but when I try to run it, it fails with X window system error.

The upgrade from 13.03 to 13.10 worked fine.  After the upgrade from 13.10 to 14.04 I ran into a problem. After logging into my computer I am left with only the background image and no other desktop or unity elements. No key bindings work ( ctrl+alt+t for example). I am able to drop into a terminal using ctrl+alt+(f1+f6). Once logged into a terminal I am able to run things like apt-get and other shell utilities. I can not run anything graphical without first telling the terminal where to send it by exporting display 0 <code>export DISPLAY=:0</code> Once I have done that I can run gui based programs like Firefox.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to note, if I run nautilus from the terminal it shows me the desktop and the bar at the top of the screen with the nautilus options ( File Edit View Go Bookmarks Help ). I have tried re-enabling unity from CCSM, no change, I have reinstalled unity and Ubuntu-Desktop, no change. I have uninstalled and reinstalled nvida-current drivers , again, no change. </p>\n\n<p>I have done everything I can think of to investigate this problem ( which is not much since I am still pretty new to this). If there is anything I should do to further investigate this let me know and I will run it asap. I am still able to switch the standard output to a file on the desktop and access it from there.

I did the following;</p>\n\n<pre><code> sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n sudo apt-get install unity\n sudo apt-get purge nvidia* bumblebee*\n sudo apt-get install nvidia-prime\n sudo shutdown -r now\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, after I log into my computer I see the items on my desktop.  I can also open nautilus by pressing <code>ctrl+n</code>.  The ability to right click has returned which allows me to open a terminal. However, <code>ctrl+alt+t</code> still does not work. I am unable to grab and move any windows around or bring program windows from the back of the desktop to the front by clicking on them.  They stay stacked in the order I opened them, with the most recent window on top. I checked Compiz Setting Manager again and unity is activated. </p>\n\n<p>Update 2:</p>\n\n<p>I think this may be an opengl problem.
