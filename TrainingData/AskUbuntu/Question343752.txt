I've tried <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MATLAB\">this guide</a> (although I know it's for 11.10 and mentions that even 11.10 is an unsupported OS for Matlab R2011a) but without any satisfactory solution.</p>\n\n<p>This is my launcher file, <code>/usr/share/applications/matlab.desktop</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/matlab.png\nName=MATLAB R2011a\nComment=Start MATLAB - The Language of Technical Computing\nExec=matlab -desktop\nCategories=Development;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I open the dash panel and search for \"matlab\". This launcher is found among applications. I click it, and Matlab's splash screen shows up, but when it disappears the program doesn't start.

However, both the terminal and Matlab itself show up in the Launcher area, with the Matlab icon, so it looks like I have <em>two</em> Matlab instances running when really it's only one. (Actually, they show up as two different programs, and not just two instances of the same - the icons are independent, not grouped together.)</p>\n\n<p>This is definitely not optimal. I had hoped to create a launcher I can lock to the launcher area, and then that same icon will be the icon for the active Matlab instance when the program is running.</p>\n\n<p>How do I create a launcher for Matlab that works as expected?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was apparently a bit unclear on my symptoms, I'll try to clarify a little.\nI've also tried some suggestions from the answers, and further investigated what happens. My current setup (a launcher file with <code>Terminal=true</code> and <code>Exec=matlab -desktop -nosplash &amp;</code>) renders the following behavior:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I open Dash by pressing the Windows key on my laptop, and search for \"matlab\". It finds the launcher named \"MATLAB R2011a\". I click it.</li>\n<li>A terminal window opens, using the icon I referred to in the launcher file. Almost immediately, MATLAB's splash screen also opens, using the same icon (and thus being grouped with the terminal window in the launcher).</li>\n<li>The splash screen disappears and, so does one of the icons in the launcher. The MATLAB desktop environment opens, <em>using a different version of the icon</em> which is displayed next to the icon for the terminal window (not grouped with it).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I can lock the terminal window's icon to the launcher and successfully start MATLAB by clicking it, but it doesn't feel optimal that I start the program with one icon, and switch to it with another. I've also tried the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Exec</code> without the ampersand <code>&amp;</code> in the launcher command, but it didn't make a difference.</li>\n<li>Executing <code>matlab -nosplash</code> manually from a terminal still shows the splash screen.
