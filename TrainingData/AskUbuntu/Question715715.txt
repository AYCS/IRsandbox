In short I want to be able to plug this device into any computer (specifically using EFI but BIOS support is also nice) and run a full Ubuntu distro with all of my personal files and applications on it. I recently have used the mkusb code from another post to try to accomplish this and while it was the closest to what I wanted it was only a persistent version of a Live disk (in other words it was a demo set up to run like a full os.) It was interesting, though, because it made me wonder that if there was a full iso file for the code to use instead of the Live USB iso will it create a persistent, full, boot-able, drive, or (with my current luck) end up being a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>I have currently looked at nearly every main break off post similar to my question but I have not found an answer. If this question has been answered in some other forum then please send me that way so I can stop obsessing over this dumb idea that I have been trying to accomplish non-stop for 4 days.

The pen drive has enough space too (8gb), the only problem is that it's a rather slow pen drive - itwrites at around 1,5 mb/s, but I'm not sure if that could even be a problem. I've tried with both persistent memory (1gb) and without. It's worth mentioning I've done this before with the same pen drive and the same laptop, the only difference being that I now got a SSD (Crucial BX100), which is why I'm reinstalling - however, I can't even load it live, so I assume it's not the SSD's fault either.</p>\n\n<p>So, I tried using unetbootin instead of Universal USB Installer, and it's now giving me a different error*:\n<code>(initramfs) unable to find a live medium containing a live file system</code></p>\n\n<p>*actually I'm not sure when this error showed up, after re-writing the .iso to the flash drive, now it just hangs after recognizing the USBs I have on, more specifically, hangs indefinitely after recognizing my webcam.

I don't have a USB 3.0 port. I've also tried using a DVD, but just my luck, my DVD drive apparently doesn't work correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I'm without ideas. I'll try using the flash drive on a friend's computer later today if I can, but if the community has any additional ideas I'd be happy.
